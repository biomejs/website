## Summary
- Rule available since: `v1.0.0`

- This action is **recommended**.
- The default severity of this rule is [**information**](/reference/diagnostics#information).
## How to enable in your editor
<EditorAction action="source.organizeImports.biome" />
## Description
Provides a whole-source code action to sort the imports in the file using import groups and natural ordering.

## How imports are sorted

Import statements are sorted by "distance". Modules that are "farther" from the user are put on the top, modules "closer" to the user are put on the bottom:

1. modules imported via `bun:` protocol. This is applicable when writing code run by Bun;
2. built-in Node.js modules that are explicitly imported using the `node:` protocol and common Node built-ins such as `assert`;
3. modules imported via `npm:` protocol. This is applicable when writing code run by Deno;
4. modules that contain the protocol `:`. These are usually considered "virtual modules", modules that are injected by your working environment, e.g. `vite`;
5. modules imported via URL;
6. modules imported from libraries;
7. modules imported via absolute imports;
8. modules imported from a name prefixed by `#`. This is applicable when using [Node's subpath imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports);
9. modules imported via relative imports;
10. modules that couldn't be identified by the previous criteria;

For example, given the following code:

```ts
import uncle from "../uncle";
import sibling from "./sibling";
import express from "npm:express";
import imageUrl from "url:./image.png";
import { sortBy } from "virtual:utils";
import assert from "node:assert";
import aunt from "../aunt";
import { VERSION } from "https://deno.land/std/version.ts";
import { mock, test } from "node:test";
import { expect } from "bun:test";
import { internal } from "#internal";
import { secret } from "/absolute/path";
import React from "react";
```

They will be sorted like this:

```ts
import { expect } from "bun:test";
import assert from "node:assert";
import { mock, test } from "node:test";
import express from "npm:express";
import { sortBy } from "virtual:utils";
import { VERSION } from "https://deno.land/std/version.ts";
import React from "react";
import { secret } from "/absolute/path";
import { internal } from "#internal";
import aunt from "../aunt";
import uncle from "../uncle";
import sibling from "./sibling";
import imageUrl from "url:./image.png";
```

You can apply the sorting in two ways: via [CLI](#import-sorting-via-cli) or [VSCode extension](#import-sorting-via-vscode-extension).

## Grouped imports

It's widespread to have import statements in a certain order, primarily when you work on a frontend project, and you import CSS files:

```js
import "../styles/reset.css";
import "../styles/layout.css";
import { Grid } from "../components/Grid.jsx";
```

Another common case is import polyfills or shim files, that needs to stay at the top file:

```js
import "../polyfills/array/flatMap";
import { functionThatUsesFlatMap } from "./utils.js";
```

In these cases, Biome will sort all these three imports, and it might happen that the order will **break** your application.

To avoid this, create a "group" of imports. You create a "group" by adding a **new line** to separate the groups.

By doing so, Biome will limit the sorting only to the import statements that belong to the same group:

```js
// group 1, only these two files will be sorted
import "../styles/reset.css";
import "../styles/layout.css";

// group 2, only this one is sorted
import { Grid } from "../components/Grid.jsx";
```

```js
// group 1, the polyfill/shim
import "../polyfills/array/flatMap";

// group 2, the files that require the polyfill/shim
import { functionThatUsesFlatMap } from "./utils.js";
```

## Side effect imports

[Side effect imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#forms_of_import_declarations) are import statements that usually don't import any name:

```js
import "./global.js"
```

Since it is difficult to determine which side effects a module triggers, the import sorter assumes that each side effect import forms its own import group.

For example, the following imports form 4 import groups.

```js
import sibling from "./sibling";       // Import group 1
import { internal } from "#internal";  // Import group 1
import "z";  // Import group 2
import "a";  // Import group 3
import React from "react";         // Import group 4
import assert from "node:assert";  // Import group 4
```

Each group is independently sorted as follows:

```js
import { internal } from "#internal";  // Import group 1
import sibling from "./sibling";      // Import group 1
import "z";  // Import group 2
import "a";  // Import group 3
import assert from "node:assert";  // Import group 4
import React from "react";         // Import group 4
```

## How to configure
```json title="biome.json"
{
	"assist": {
		"actions": {
			"source": {
				"organizeImports": "on"
			}
		}
	}
}

```
