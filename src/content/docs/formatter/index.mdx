import PackageManagerBiomeCommand from "@/components/PackageManagerBiomeCommand.astro";

Biome is an opinionated formatter that [supports multiple languages](/internals/language-support).
It follows a similar [philosophy to Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html),
only supporting a few options to avoid debates over styles, turning into debates over Biome options.
It deliberately [resists the urge to add new options](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/40) to prevent [bike-shed discussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) in teams so they can focus on what really matters instead.


## CLI

The following command checks the formatting of the files in the `src` directory.
It emits text differences if it finds code that is not formatted.

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="format ./src" />

If you want to **apply** the new formatting, pass the `--write` option:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="format --write ./src" />

The command accepts a list of files and directories.

:::caution
If you pass a glob as a parameter, your shell will expand it.
The result of the expansion depends on your shell.
For example, some shells don't support the recursive glob `**` or the alternation `{}` in the following command:

```shell
biome format ./src/**/*.test.{js,ts}
```

Shell expansion has a performance cost and a limit on the number of files you can pass to the command.

For more information about all the available options, check the [CLI reference](/reference/cli#biome-format).


## Options

Biome provides some options to tune the behavior of its formatter.
Differently from other tools, Biome separates language-agnostic options from language-specific options.

The formatter options can be set on the [CLI](/reference/cli/#biome-format) or in the `biome.json` configuration file.
Biome doesn't support `.editorconfig` [yet](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1724).

It's recommended to use the [configuration](/guides/how-biome-works#configuration) file to ensure that both the Biome CLI and the Biome LSP apply the same options.
The following defaults are applied:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "formatWithErrors": false,
    "ignore": [],
    "attributePosition": "auto",
    "indentStyle": "tab",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "lineEnding": "lf"
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "arrowParentheses":"always",
      "bracketSameLine": false,
      "bracketSpacing": true,
      "jsxQuoteStyle": "double",
      "quoteProperties": "asNeeded",
      "semicolons": "always",
      "trailingCommas": "all"
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "formatter": {
      "trailingCommas": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

The main language-agnostic options supported by the Biome formatter are:

- indent style (default: `tab`): Use spaces or tabs for indention;
- indent width (default: `2`): The number of spaces per indention level.
- line width (default: `80`): The column width at which Biome wraps code;

See the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration#formatter) for more details.


## Ignoring Code

There are times when the formatted code isn't ideal.

For these cases, you can use a format suppression comment:

```js title="example.js"
// biome-ignore format: <explanation>
```

Example:

```js title="example.js"
const expr =
  // biome-ignore format: the array should not be formatted
  [
    (2 * n) / (r - l),
    0,
    (r + l) / (r - l),
    0,
    0,
    (2 * n) / (t - b),
    (t + b) / (t - b),
    0,
    0,
    0,
    -(f + n) / (f - n),
    -(2 * f * n) / (f - n),
    0,
    0,
    -1,
    0,
  ];
```


## Ignoring files

Biome doesn't provide ignore comments that ignore an entire file.
However, you can ignore a file using the Biome configuration file.

You can ignore files for all tools, including the formatter,
using the [`files.ignore` configuration](/guides/how-biome-works#include-and-ignore-explained).
By default, Biome ignores the [protected files](/guides/how-biome-works#protected-files).

If you want to exclude files from being formatted, you can use `formatter.ignore`:

```json title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    // All tools, including the formatter, ignore following files
    "ignore": ["dist/**"]
  },
  "formatter": {
    // Only the formatter ignores the following files
    "ignore": ["test/**"]
  }
}
```

Note that you can also [ignore files ignored by your VCS](/guides/integrate-in-vcs#use-the-ignore-file).
