description: Using Biome in a CI environment
---

Running Biome in a CI environment is easy. Check out the following examples for some inspiration.

### `biome check` VS `biome ci`

Biome offers two CLI commands to run all checks: `biome check` and `biome ci`, however the latter should be used in CI (Continuous Integration) environments.

Compared to the `check` command, the `ci` command:
- Doesn't provide any `--write`/`--fix` option.
- Integrates better with specific runners. For example, when run on GitHub, the diagnostics are printed using the GitHub annotations.
- Allows controlling the number of threads.
- When VCS integration is enabled, it uses the `--changed` flag instead of `--staged`, because a remote repository doesn't have the concept of "staged files".

With time, the `ci` command will receive more and more features.

## GitHub Actions

We provide a first-party [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-biome) to setup Biome in your runner.
Here's what a simple workflow might look like:

```yaml title="pull_request.yml"
name: Code quality

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - name: Setup Biome
        uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v2
        with:
          version: latest
      - name: Run Biome
        run: biome ci .
```

If your Biome configuration has external dependencies (e.g., extends a config from a package), you'll need to setup Node.js and install dependencies using your preferred package manager before running Biome:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22 # or your preferred version
    cache: "npm" # or 'yarn', 'pnpm'
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci # or yarn install --frozen-lockfile, pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Third-party actions

These are actions maintained by other communities, that you use in your runner:

- [reviewdog-action-biome](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-biome-with-reviewdog): run Biome with reviewdog and make comments and commit suggestions on the pull request.

```yaml title="pull_request.yml"
name: reviewdog
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  biome:
    name: runner / Biome
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: mongolyy/reviewdog-action-biome@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
          reporter: github-pr-review
```

## GitLab CI

Below is an example configuration:

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Define pipeline stages
stages:
  - quality

# Lint job configuration: runs code quality checks using Biome
lint:
    image:
      name: ghcr.io/biomejs/biome:latest  # Use the latest Biome Docker image
      entrypoint: [""]                    # This is required for the image to work in GitLab CI
    stage: quality                        # Run in the quality stage
    script:
        - biome ci --reporter=gitlab --colors=off > /tmp/code-quality.json
        - cp /tmp/code-quality.json code-quality.json
    artifacts:
      reports:
        codequality:
          - code-quality.json    # Collect the code quality report artifact
    rules:
        - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH    # Run job for commits on branches
        - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID # Run job for merge requests
```
