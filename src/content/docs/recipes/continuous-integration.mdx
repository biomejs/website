description: Using Biome in a CI environment
---

Running Biome in a CI environment is easy. Check out the following examples for some inspiration.

## GitHub Actions

We provide a first-party [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-biome) to setup Biome in your runner.
Here's what a simple workflow might look like:

```yaml title="pull_request.yml"
name: Code quality

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Biome
        uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v2
        with:
          version: latest
      - name: Run Biome
        run: biome ci .
```

### Third-party actions

These are actions maintained by other communities, that you use in your runner:

- [reviewdog-action-biome](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-biome-with-reviewdog): run Biome with reviewdog and make comments and commit suggestions on the pull request.

```yaml title="pull_request.yml"
name: reviewdog
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  biome:
    name: runner / Biome
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: mongolyy/reviewdog-action-biome@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
          reporter: github-pr-review
```

## GitLab CI

Below is an example configuration:

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
# Define pipeline stages
stages:
  - quality

# Lint job configuration: runs code quality checks using Biome
lint:
    image: 
      name: ghcr.io/biomejs/biome:latest  # Use the latest Biome Docker image
      entrypoint: [""]                    # This is required for the image to work in GitLab CI
    stage: quality                        # Run in the quality stage
    script:
        - biome ci src --reporter=gitlab --colors=off --log-level=none --diagnostic-level=error > code-quality.json  # Execute Biome on the 'src' directory
    artifacts:
        paths:
            - code-quality.json    # Collect the code quality report as an artifact
    rules:
        - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH    # Run job for commits on branches
        - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID # Run job for merge requests
    allow_failure: true            # Allow the job to fail (adjust as needed)
```

:::note
If your project's source code is located in another directory, replace `src` with that directory's path in the command.
