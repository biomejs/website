## `$schema`

Allows to pass a path to a JSON schema file.

We publish a JSON schema file for our `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc` files.

You can specify a relative path to the schema inside the `@biomejs/biome` NPM
package if it is installed in the `node_modules` folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json"
}
```

If you have problems with resolving the physical file, you can use the one
published on this site:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.5/schema.json"
}
```

## `extends`

A list of paths to other Biome configuration files. Biome resolves and applies
the configuration settings from the files contained in the `extends` list, and
eventually applies the options contained in this `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc`
file.

The order of paths to extend goes from least relevant to most relevant.

Since v2, this option accepts a string that must match the value `"//"`, which can be used
when setting up [monorepos](/guides/big-projects#monorepo)

## `root`

Whether this configuration should be treated as a root. By default, any configuration file is considered a root by default.
When a configuration file is a "nested configuration", it must set `"root": false`, otherwise an error is thrown.

This is required so Biome can orchestrate multiple files in CLI and editors at the same time.

> Default: `true`


## `files`

### `files.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to process.

If a folder matches a glob pattern, all files inside that folder will be
processed.

The following example matches all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern. When using a negated pattern, you
should always specify `**` first to match all files and folders, otherwise
the negated pattern will not match any files.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js", "!test"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are processed, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still processed...
4. ... _except_ when it occurs in the folder named `test`, because _no_ files
   inside that folder are processed.

:::note
Using `!test` to completely exclude a directory is only supported in `files.includes`. In other places where `includes` is used (`linter.includes`, `formatter.includes`, etc.), you need to use `!/test/**` to exclude the directory.
:::

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** processed.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** processed.
* `src/special.test.js` **is** processed.
* `test/special.test.js` **is not** processed.

Note that files inside `node_modules/` are ignored regardless of the
`files.includes` setting.

#### Interaction with the scanner

Biome has a [scanner](/internals/architecture/#scanner) that is responsible for
discovering nested configuration files as well as `.gitignore` files. It can
also index source files if one or more rules from the
[project domain](/linter/domains/#project) are enabled.

The scanner respects both `files.includes` and the ignored patterns from
`.gitignore` files, but there are two exceptions to be aware of:
* Special files such as `biome.json` and `.gitignore` take priority over any
  ignored patterns in `files.includes`.
* If any rule from the project domain is enabled, the scanner will index source
  files _including their dependencies_. This means that files that are ignored
  as part of `files.includes` may still get indexed by the scanner, as long as
  there is another included file that imports those files. And this also
  means that `.d.ts` files and `package.json` manifests inside `node_modules/`
  may still get indexed too.

If you want to explicitly force some files to be ignored by the scanner, you can
do so using a so-called _force-ignore pattern_. A force-ignore pattern looks
like a regular negated pattern, but starts with a double exclamation mark
(`!!`).

For example, you can tell Biome to never look inside any `dist/` folder using
the following configuration:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["**", "!!**/dist"]
  }
}
```

We recommend using the force-ignore syntax for any folders that contain _output_
files, such as `build/` and `dist/`. For such folders, it is highly unlikely
that indexing has any useful benefits. For folders containing generated files,
we advise using regular ignore patterns so that type information can still be
extracted from the files.

For nested `biome.json` files as well as `.gitignore` files that you wish to
explicitly ignore, the force-ignore syntax must also be used.

### `files.ignoreUnknown`

If `true`, Biome won't emit diagnostics if it encounters files that it can't
handle.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "ignoreUnknown": true
  }
}
```

> Default: `false`

### `files.maxSize`

The maximum allowed size for source code files in bytes. Files above
this limit will be ignored for performance reasons.

> Default: `1048576` (1024*1024, 1MB)

### `files.experimentalScannerIgnores`

:::caution
This option has been **deprecated** and may be removed in a future release.
Please use the
[_force-ignore syntax_](/reference/configuration/#interaction-with-the-scanner)
with `files.includes` instead.
:::

An array of literal path segments that the scanner should ignore during the
crawling. The ignored files won't be indexed, which means that these files won't
be part of the module graph, and types won't be inferred from them.

## `vcs`

Set of properties to integrate Biome with a VCS (Version Control Software).

### `vcs.enabled`

Whether Biome should integrate itself with the VCS client

> Default: `false`

### `vcs.clientKind`

The kind of client.

Values:
- `"git"`

### `vcs.useIgnoreFile`

Whether Biome should use the project's VCS ignore files. When `true`, Biome will ignore the files
specified in the VCS ignore files as well as those specified in `.ignore` files.

This feature supports nested ignore files too.

The root ignore file yields the same semantics as the root [`files.includes`](/reference/configuration#filesincludes).

### `vcs.root`

The folder where Biome should check for VCS files. By default, Biome will use the same
folder where `biome.json` was found.

If Biome can't find the configuration, it will attempt to use the current working directory.
If no current working directory can't be found, Biome won't use the VCS integration, and a diagnostic
will be emitted

### `vcs.defaultBranch`

The main branch of the project. Biome will use this branch when evaluating the changed files.

## `linter`

### `linter.enabled`

Enables Biome's linter.

> Default: `true`

### `linter.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to lint.

The following example lints all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are linted, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still linted.

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** linted.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** linted.
* `src/special.test.js` **is* linted.

Note that `linter.includes` is applied *after* `files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`linter.includes`. This means the following example **doesn't work**:

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": "src/**"
  },
  "linter": {
    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:
    "includes": "scripts/**"
  }
}
```

If `linter.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](#filesincludes) are linted.

:::note
Due to a technical limitation, `linter.includes` also cannot match folders
while `files.includes` can. If you want to match all files inside a folder,
you should explicitly add `/**` at the end.
:::

### `linter.rules.recommended`

Enables the recommended rules for all groups.

> Default: `true`


### `linter.rules.[group]`

Options that influence the rules of a single group. Biome supports the following groups:

- accessibility: Rules focused on preventing accessibility problems.
- complexity: Rules that focus on inspecting complex code that could be simplified.
- correctness: Rules that detect code that is guaranteed to be incorrect or useless.
- nursery: New rules that are still under development.  Nursery rules require explicit opt-in via configuration on stable versions because they may still have bugs or performance problems (even if they are marked as recommended). They are enabled by default on nightly builds, but as they are unstable their diagnostic severity may be set to either error or warning, depending on whether we intend for the rule to be recommended or not when it eventually gets stabilized. Nursery rules get promoted to other groups once they become stable or may be removed.  Rules that belong to this group are not subject to semantic version.
- performance: Rules catching ways your code could be written to run faster, or generally be more efficient.
- security: Rules that detect potential security flaws.
- style: Rules enforcing a consistent and idiomatic way of writing your code.
- suspicious: Rules that detect code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.

Each group can accept, as a value, a string that represents the severity or an object where each rule can be configured.

When passing the severity, you can control the severity emitted by all the rules that belong to a group.
For example, you can configure the `a11y` group to emit information diagnostics:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "a11y": "info"
    }
  }
}
```

Here are the accepted values:
- `"on"`: each rule that belongs to the group will emit a diagnostic with the default severity of the rule. Refer to the documentation of the rule, or use the `explain` command:
    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
    biome explain noDebugger
    ```
- `"off"`: none of the rules that belong to the group will emit any diagnostics.
- `"info"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with information severity](/reference/diagnostics#information).
- `"warn"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with warning severity](/reference/diagnostics#warning).
- `"error"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with error severity](/reference/diagnostics#error).


### `linter.rules.[group].recommended`

Enables the recommended rules for a single group.

Example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "nursery": {
        "recommended": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## `assist`

### `assist.enabled`

Enables Biome's assist.

> Default: `true`


### `assist.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to lint.

The following example analyzes all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "assist": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "assist": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are analyzed, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still analyzed.

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** analysed.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** analyzed.
* `src/special.test.js` **is* analyzed.

Note that `assist.includes` is applied *after* `files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`assist.includes`. This means the following example **doesn't work**:

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": "src/**"
  },
  "assist": {
    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:
    "includes": "scripts/**"
  }
}
```

If `assist.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](#filesincludes) are linted.

:::note
Due to a technical limitation, `assist.includes` also cannot match folders
while `files.includes` can. If you want to match all files inside a folder,
you should explicitly add `/**` at the end.
:::

### `assist.actions.recommended`

Enables the recommended actions for all groups.

### `assist.actions.[group]`

Options that influence the rules of a single group. Biome supports the following groups:

- source: This group represents those actions that can be safely applied to a document upon saving. These actions are all generally safe, they typically don’t change the functionality of the program.

### `assist.actions.[group].recommended`

Enables the recommended rules for a single group.

Example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "assist": {
    "enabled": true,
    "actions": {
      "source": {
        "recommended": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## `formatter`

These options apply to all languages. There are additional language-specific formatting options below.

### `formatter.enabled`

Enables Biome's formatter.

> Default: `true`

### `formatter.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to format.

The following example formats all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are formatted, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still formatted.

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** formatted.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** formatted.
* `src/special.test.js` **is** formatted.

Note that `formatter.includes` is applied *after* `files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`formatter.includes`. This means the following example **doesn't work**:

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": "src/**"
  },
  "formatter": {
    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:
    "includes": "scripts/**"
  }
}
```

If `formatter.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](#filesincludes) are formatted.

:::note
Due to a technical limitation, `formatter.includes` also cannot match folders
while `files.includes` can. If you want to match all files inside a folder,
you should explicitly add `/**` at the end.
:::

### `formatter.formatWithErrors`

Allows to format a document that has syntax errors.



```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "formatWithErrors": true
  }
}
```

> Default: `false`

### `formatter.indentStyle`

The style of the indentation. It can be `"tab"` or `"space"`.

> Default: `"tab"`


### `formatter.indentWidth`

- `"cr"`, Carriage Return character only (`\r`), used very rarely.

> Default: `"lf"`

### `formatter.lineWidth`

The amount of characters that can be written on a single line..

> Default: `80`

### `formatter.attributePosition`

The attribute position style in HTMLish languages.
- `"auto"`, the attributes are automatically formatted, and they will collapse in multiple lines only when they hit certain criteria;
- `"multiline"`, the attributes will collapse in multiple lines if more than 1 attribute is used.

> Default: `"auto"`

### `formatter.bracketSpacing`

Choose whether spaces should be added between brackets and inner values.

> Default: `true`

### `formatter.expand`

Whether to expand arrays and objects on multiple lines.
- `"auto"`, object literals are formatted on multiple lines if the first property has a newline,
  and array literals are formatted on a single line if it fits in the line.
- `"always"`, these literals are formatted on multiple lines, regardless of length of the list.
- `"never"`, these literals are formatted on a single line if it fits in the line.

When formatting `package.json`, Biome will use `always` unless configured otherwise.

> Default: `"auto"`

### `formatter.useEditorconfig`

Whether Biome should use the `.editorconfig` file to determine the formatting options.

The config files `.editorconfig` and `biome.json` will follow the following rules:

- Formatting settings in `biome.json` always take precedence over `.editorconfig` files.
- `.editorconfig` files that exist higher up in the hierarchy than a `biome.json` file are already ignored. This is to avoid loading formatting settings from someone's home directory into a project with a `biome.json` file.
- Nested `.editorconfig` files aren't supported currently.

> Default: `false`


## `javascript`

These options apply only to JavaScript (and TypeScript) files.

### `javascript.parser.unsafeParameterDecoratorsEnabled`

- `"none"`, trailing commas are never added.

> Default: `"all"`

### `javascript.formatter.semicolons`

It configures where the formatter prints semicolons:
- `"always"`, the semicolons is always added at the end of each statement;
- `"asNeeded"`, the semicolons are added only in places where it's needed, to protect from [ASI](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Automatic_semicolon_insertion).

> Default: `"always"`

Example:


```json title="biome.json"
{
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "semicolons": "asNeeded"
    }
  }
}
```

### `javascript.formatter.arrowParentheses`

- `"multiline"`, enforce single attribute per line.

> Default: `"auto"`

### `javascript.formatter.expand`

Whether to expand arrays and objects on multiple lines.
- `"auto"`, object literals are formatted on multiple lines if the first property has a newline,
  and array literals are formatted on a single line if it fits in the line.

## `html`

:::caution
While HTML parser, formatter and linter are enabled by default, they are still considered experimental.
Breaking changes will be reduced to a minimum, however the introduction of fixes and features might change
the behavior of the tools.
:::

### `html.experimentalFullSupportEnabled`

When enabled, Biome enables full support for HTML-ish languages. Parsing, formatting and linting of
embedded languages inside these files are consistent.

### `html.parser.interpolation`

Enables the parsing of double text expressions such as `{{ expression }}` inside `.html` files.

> Default: `false`

### `html.formatter.enabled`

Enables Biome's formatter for HTML files.

> Default: `false`

### `html.formatter.indentStyle`

The style of the indentation for HTML files. It can be `"tab"` or `"space"`.

> Default: `"tab"`

### `html.formatter.indentWidth`

How big the indentation should be for HTML files.

> Default: `2`

### `html.formatter.lineEnding`

The type of line ending for HTML files.
- `"lf"`, Line Feed only (`\n`), common on Linux and macOS as well as inside git repos;
- `"crlf"`, Carriage Return + Line Feed characters (`\r\n`), common on Windows;
- `"cr"`, Carriage Return character only (`\r`), used very rarely.

> Default: `"lf"`

### `html.formatter.lineWidth`

The amount of characters that can be written on a single line in HTML files.

> Default: `80`

### `html.formatter.attributePosition`

The attribute position style in HTML elements.
- `"auto"`, the attributes are automatically formatted, and they will collapse in multiple lines only when they hit certain criteria;
- `"multiline"`, the attributes will collapse in multiple lines if more than 1 attribute is used.

> Default: `"auto"`

### `html.formatter.bracketSameLine`

Whether to hug the closing bracket of multiline HTML tags to the end of the last line, rather than being alone on the following line.

> Default: `false`

### `html.formatter.whitespaceSensitivity`

<div style="display: none">whitespaceSensitivity, whitespace sensitivity</div>

Whether to account for whitespace sensitivity when formatting HTML (and its super languages).

> Default: "css"


- `"css"`: The formatter considers whitespace significant for elements that have an "inline" display style by default in browser's user agent style sheets.
- `"strict"`: Leading and trailing whitespace in content is considered significant for all elements.

  The formatter should leave at least one whitespace character if whitespace is present.
  Otherwise, if there is no whitespace, it should not add any after `>` or before `<`. In other words, if there's no whitespace, the text content should hug the tags.

  Example of text hugging the tags:
  ```html
  <b
     >content</b
  >
  ```
- `"ignore"`: whitespace is considered insignificant. The formatter is free to remove or add whitespace as it sees fit.

### `html.formatter.indentScriptAndStyle`

<div style="display: none">indentScriptAndStyle, indent script, indent style</div>

*Since 2.3: Only affects `.vue` and `.svelte` files*

Whether to indent the content of `<script>` and `<style>` tags for Vue and Svelte files. Currently, this does not apply to plain HTML files.

> Default: `false`

When true, the content of `<script>` and `<style>` tags will be indented by one level relative to the tags.

```vue title="foo.vue" del={2} ins={3}
<script>
import Bar from "./Bar.vue";
  import Bar from "./Bar.vue";
</script>
```

### `html.formatter.selfCloseVoidElements`

<div style="display: none">selfCloseVoidElements, void elements, self closing elements</div>

Whether void elements should be self-closed. Defaults to never.

> Default: `"never"`

- `"never"`: The slash `/` inside void elements is removed by the formatter.
- `"always"`: The slash `/` inside void elements is always added.

### `html.linter.enabled`

Enables Biome's linter for HTML files.

> Default: `true`

### `html.linter.assist`

Enables Biome's assist for HTML files.

> Default: `true`


## `overrides`

A list of patterns.

Use this configuration to change the behaviour of the tools for certain files.

When a file is matched against an override pattern, the configuration specified in that pattern will be override the top-level configuration.

The order of the patterns matter. If a file *can* match three patterns, only the first one is used.

### `overrides.<ITEM>.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) of
files for which to apply customised settings.

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "overrides": [{
    "includes": ["scripts/*.js"],
    // settings that should only apply to the files specified in the includes field.
  }]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.formatter`

Includes the options of the [top level formatter](#formatter) configuration, minus `ignore` and `include`.

#### Examples

For example, it's possible to modify the formatter `lineWidth`, `indentStyle` for certain files that are included in the glob path `generated/**`:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "lineWidth": 100
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": ["generated/**"],
      "formatter": {
        "lineWidth": 160,
        "indentStyle": "space"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.linter`

Includes the options of the [top level linter](#linter) configuration, minus `ignore` and `include`.


#### Examples

You can disable certain rules for certain glob paths, and disable the linter for other glob paths:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": ["lib/**"],
      "linter": {
        "rules": {
          "suspicious": {
            "noDebugger": "off"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "includes": ["shims/**"],
      "linter": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.javascript`

Includes the options of the [top level javascript](#javascript) configuration. Lets you override JavaScript-specific settings for certain files.

#### Examples

You can change the formatting behaviour of JavaScript files in certain folders:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "lineWidth": 120
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single"
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": ["lib/**"],
      "javascript": {
        "formatter": {
          "quoteStyle": "double"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


### `overrides.<ITEM>.json`

Includes the options of the [top level json](#json) configuration. Lets you override JSON-specific settings for certain files.


#### Examples

You can enable parsing features for certain JSON files:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": [".vscode/**"],
      "json": {
        "parser": {
          "allowComments": true,
          "allowTrailingCommas": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.[language]`

Includes the options of the top level language configuration. Lets you override language-specific settings for certain files.

## Glob syntax reference

Glob patterns are used to match paths of files and folders. Biome supports the
following syntax in globs:

- `*` matches zero or more characters. It cannot match the path separator `/`.
- `**` recursively matches directories and files. This sequence must be used as
  an entire path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result
  in an error. A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also
  invalid.
- `[...]` matches any character inside the brackets.
  Ranges of characters can also be specified, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g.
  `[0-9]` specifies any character between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `[!...]` is the negation of `[...]`, i.e. it matches any characters **not** in
  the brackets.
- If the entire glob starts with `!`, it is a so-called negated pattern. This
  glob only matches if the path _doesn't_ match the glob. Negated patterns
  cannot be used alone, they can only be used as _exception_ to a regular glob.
- When determining whether a file is included or not, Biome considers the parent
  folders too. This means that if you want to _include_ all files in a folder,
  you need to use the `/**` suffix to match those files. But if you want to
  _ignore_ all files in a folder, you may do so without the `/**` suffix. We
  recommend ignoring folders without the trailing `/**`, to avoid needlessly
  traversing it, as well as to avoid the risk of Biome loading a `biome.json` or
  a `.gitignore` file from an ignored folder.

Some examples:

- `dist/**` matches the `dist/` folder and all files inside it.
- `!dist` ignores the `dist/` folder and all files inside it.
- `**/test/**` matches all files under any folder named `test`, regardless of
  where they are. E.g. `dist/test`, `src/test`.
- `**/*.js` matches all files ending with the extension `.js` in all folders.

:::caution
Glob patterns can be used in a Biome configuration file, but they can also be
specified from the command line. When you specify a glob on the command line,
it is interpreted by your shell rather than by Biome. Shells may support
slightly different syntax for globs. For instance, some shells do not support
the recursive pattern `**`.
