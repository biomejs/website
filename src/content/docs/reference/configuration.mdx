## `$schema`

Allows to pass a path to a JSON schema file.

We publish a JSON schema file for our `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc` files.

You can specify a relative path to the schema inside the `@biomejs/biome` NPM
package if it is installed in the `node_modules` folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json"
}
```

If you have problems with resolving the physical file, you can use the one
published on this site:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.0-beta/schema.json"
}
```

## `extends`

A list of paths to other Biome configuration files. Biome resolves and applies
the configuration settings from the files contained in the `extends` list, and
eventually applies the options contained in this `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc`
file.

The order of paths to extend goes from least relevant to most relevant.

## `files`

### `files.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to process.

If a folder matches a glob pattern, all files inside that folder will be
processed.

The following example matches all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js", "!test"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are processed, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still processed...
4. ... _except_ when it occurs in the folder named `test`, because _no_ files
   inside that folder are processed.

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** processed.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** processed.
* `src/special.test.js` **is* processed.
* `test/special.test.js` **is not* processed.

#### Note on Biome's scanner

Biome has a scanner that is responsible for discovering `.gitignore` files as
well as indexing projects if any of the rules from the project domain are
enabled.

The scanner respects `files.includes`, with two exceptions:

* If the project domain or one of its rules is enabled, dependencies in
  `node_modules` are still read, even if they're ignored in `files.includes`.
  This is because they may be a valuable source of type information.
* The scanner will not ignore individual files if they are in a non-ignored
  directory. This is because files that are co-located with regular
  (non-ignored) files are likely to be a valuable source of type information,
  and they are also more likely to form import cycles with other files.

This means that if you use `files.includes` to ignore folders with generated
code, type information from such folders is inaccessible to the scanner. If you
do wish to have such type information available, we advise to _not_ ignore these
folders through `files.includes` and instead ignore them using tool-specific 
settings such as `linter.includes` and `formatter.includes` only.

### `files.ignoreUnknown`

If `true`, Biome won't emit diagnostics if it encounters files that it can't
handle.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "ignoreUnknown": true
  }
}
```

> Default: `false`

### `files.maxSize`

The maximum allowed size for source code files in bytes. Files above
this limit will be ignored for performance reasons.

> Default: `1048576` (1024*1024, 1MB)

## `vcs`

Set of properties to integrate Biome with a VCS (Version Control Software).

### `vcs.enabled`

Whether Biome should integrate itself with the VCS client

> Default: `false`

### `vcs.clientKind`

The kind of client.

Values:
- `"git"`

### `vcs.useIgnoreFile`

Whether Biome should use the VCS ignore file. When `true`, Biome will ignore the files
specified in the ignore file.

### `vcs.root`

The folder where Biome should check for VCS files. By default, Biome will use the same
folder where `biome.json` was found.

If Biome can't find the configuration, it will attempt to use the current working directory.
If no current working directory can't be found, Biome won't use the VCS integration, and a diagnostic
will be emitted

### `vcs.defaultBranch`

The main branch of the project. Biome will use this branch when evaluating the changed files.

## `linter`

### `linter.enabled`

Enables Biome's linter.

> Default: `true`

### `linter.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to lint.

The following example lints all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are linted, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still linted.

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** linted.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** linted.
* `src/special.test.js` **is* linted.

Note that `linter.includes` is applied *after* `files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`linter.includes`. This means the following example **doesn't work**:

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": "src/**"
  },
  "linter": {
    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:
    "includes": "scripts/**"
  }
}
```

If `linter.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](#filesincludes) are linted.

:::note
Due to a technical limitation, `linter.includes` also cannot match folders
while `files.includes` can. If you want to match all files inside a folder,
you should explicitly add `/**` at the end.
:::

### `linter.rules.recommended`

Enables the recommended rules for all groups.

> Default: `true`


### `linter.rules.[group]`

Options that influence the rules of a single group. Biome supports the following groups:

- accessibility: Rules focused on preventing accessibility problems.
- complexity: Rules that focus on inspecting complex code that could be simplified.
- correctness: Rules that detect code that is guaranteed to be incorrect or useless.
- nursery: New rules that are still under development.  Nursery rules require explicit opt-in via configuration on stable versions because they may still have bugs or performance problems. They are enabled by default on nightly builds, but as they are unstable their diagnostic severity may be set to either error or warning, depending on whether we intend for the rule to be recommended or not when it eventually gets stabilized. Nursery rules get promoted to other groups once they become stable or may be removed.  Rules that belong to this group are not subject to semantic version.
- performance: Rules catching ways your code could be written to run faster, or generally be more efficient.
- security: Rules that detect potential security flaws.
- style: Rules enforcing a consistent and idiomatic way of writing your code.
- suspicious: Rules that detect code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.

Each group can accept, as a value, a string that represents the severity or an object where each rule can be configured.

When passing the severity, you can control the severity emitted by all the rules that belong to a group.
For example, you can configure the `a11y` group to emit information diagnostics:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "a11y": "info"
    }
  }
}
```

Here are the accepted values:
- `"on"`: each rule that belongs to the group will emit a diagnostic with the default severity of the rule. Refer to the documentation of the rule, or use the `explain` command:
    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
    biome explain noDebugger
    ```
- `"off"`: none of the rules that belong to the group will emit any diagnostics.
- `"info"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with information severity](/reference/diagnostics#information).
- `"warn"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with warning severity](/reference/diagnostics#warning).
- `"error"`: all rules that belong to the group will emit a [diagnostic with error severity](/reference/diagnostics#error).


### `linter.rules.[group].recommended`

Enables the recommended rules for a single group.

Example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "nursery": {
        "recommended": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## `formatter`

These options apply to all languages. There are additional language-specific formatting options below.

### `formatter.enabled`

Enables Biome's formatter.

> Default: `true`

### `formatter.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](#glob-syntax-reference) of files to format.

The following example formats all files with a `.js` extension inside the `src`
folder:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js"]
  }
}
```

`*` is used to match _all files in a folder_, while `**` _recursively_ matches
all files and subfolders in a folder. For more information on globs, see the
[glob syntax reference](#glob-syntax-reference)

`includes` also supports negated patterns, or exceptions. These are patterns
that start with `!` and they can be used to instruct Biome to process all files
_except_ those matching the negated pattern.

Note that exceptions are processed in order, allowing you to specify exceptions
to exceptions.

Consider the following example:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "includes": ["**", "!**/*.test.js", "**/special.test.js"]
  }
}
```

This example specifies that:

1. All files inside all (sub)folders are formatted, thanks to the `**` pattern...
2. ... _except_ when those files have a `.test.js` extension...
3. ... but the file `special.test.ts` _is_ still formatted.

This means that:

* `src/app.js` **is** formatted.
* `src/app.test.js` **is not** formatted.
* `src/special.test.js` **is* formatted.

Note that `formatter.includes` is applied *after* `files.includes`. This means
that any file that is not matched by `files.includes` can no longer be matched
`formatter.includes`. This means the following example **doesn't work**:

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": "src/**"
  },
  "formatter": {
    // This matches nothing because there is no overlap with `files.includes`:
    "includes": "scripts/**"
  }
}
```

If `formatter.includes` is not specified, all files matched by
[`files.includes`](#filesincludes) are formatted.

:::note
Due to a technical limitation, `formatter.includes` also cannot match folders
while `files.includes` can. If you want to match all files inside a folder,
you should explicitly add `/**` at the end.
:::

### `formatter.bracketSpacing`

Choose whether spaces should be added between brackets and inner values.

> Default: `true`

### `formatter.useEditorconfig`

Whether Biome should use the `.editorconfig` file to determine the formatting options. 

The config files `.editorconfig` and `biome.json` will follow the follwing rules:

- Formatting settings in `biome.json` always take precedence over `.editorconfig` files.
- `.editorconfig` files that exist higher up in the hierarchy than a `biome.json` file are already ignored. This is to avoid loading formatting settings from someone's home directory into a project with a `biome.json` file.
- Nested `.editorconfig` files aren't supported currently.

> Default: `false`


## `javascript`

These options apply only to JavaScript (and TypeScript) files.

Enables Biome's linter for Grit files.

> Default: `true`

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "grit": {
    "linter": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

### `grit.assist.enabled`

Enables Biome's assist for Grit files.

> Default: `true`

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "grit": {
    "assist": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```


## `overrides`

A list of patterns.

Use this configuration to change the behaviour of the tools for certain files.

When a file is matched against an override pattern, the configuration specified in that pattern will be override the top-level configuration.

The order of the patterns matter. If a file *can* match three patterns, only the first one is used.

### `overrides.<ITEM>.includes`

A list of [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) of
files for which to apply customised settings.

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "overrides": [{
    "includes": ["scripts/*.js"],
    // settings that should only apply to the files specified in the includes field.
  }]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.formatter`

It will include the options of [top level formatter](#formatter) configuration, minus `ignore` and `include`.

#### Examples

For example, it's possible to modify the formatter `lineWidth`, `indentStyle` for certain files that are included in the glob path `generated/**`:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "lineWidth": 100
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": ["generated/**"],
      "formatter": {
        "lineWidth": 160,
        "indentStyle": "space"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.linter`

It will include the options of [top level linter](#linter) configuration, minus `ignore` and `include`.


#### Examples

You can disable certain rules for certain glob paths, and disable the linter for other glob paths:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": ["lib/**"],
      "linter": {
        "rules": {
          "suspicious": {
            "noDebugger": "off"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "includes": ["shims/**"],
      "linter": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `overrides.<ITEM>.organizeImports`

It will include the options of [top level organize imports](#organizeimports), minus `ignore` and `include`.

### `overrides.<ITEM>.javascript`

It will include the options of [top level javascript](#javascript) configuration.

#### Examples

You can change the formatting behaviour of JavaScript files in certain folders:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "lineWidth": 120
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single"
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": ["lib/**"],
      "javascript": {
        "formatter": {
          "quoteStyle": "double"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


### `overrides.<ITEM>.json`

It will include the options of [top level json](#json) configuration.


#### Examples

You can enable parsing features for certain JSON files:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "includes": [".vscode/**"],
      "json": {
        "parser": {
          "allowComments": true,
          "allowTrailingCommas": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Glob syntax reference

Glob patterns are used to match paths of files and folders. Biome supports the
following syntax in globs:

- `*` matches zero or more characters. It cannot match the path separator `/`.
- `**` recursively matches directories and files. This sequence must be used as
  an entire path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result
  in an error. A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also
  invalid.
- `[...]` matches any character inside the brackets.
  Ranges of characters can also be specified, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g.
  `[0-9]` specifies any character between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `[!...]` is the negation of `[...]`, i.e. it matches any characters **not** in
  the brackets.
- If the entire glob starts with `!`, it is a so-called negated pattern. This
  glob only matches if the path _doesn't_ match the glob. Negated patterns
  cannot be used alone, they can only be used as _exception_ to a regular glob.

Some examples:

- `dist/**` matches the `dist/` folder and all files inside it.
- `**/test/**` matches all files under any folder named `test`, regardless of
  where they are. E.g. `dist/test`, `src/test`.
- `**/*.js` matches all files ending with the extension `.js` in all folders.

:::caution
Glob patterns can be used in a Biome configuration file, but they can also be
specified from the command line. When you specify a glob on the command line,
it is interpreted by your shell rather than by Biome. Shells may support
slightly different syntax for globs. For instance, some shells do not support
the recursive pattern `**`.
