description: Notes about the Biome's VSCode extension
---

**Biome** ships with a first-party **VS Code extension** that provides the following 
features.

- Format on save
- Real-time code linting
- Code refactoring with quick fixes

In this document, we'll go over how to install and configure the extension.

## Installing the extension

The extension is available both on the 
[VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) and the 
[Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/biomejs/biome) and can be installed directly
by clicking one of the following links:

## Projects

The Biome extension operates on so-called _projects_. A project is a directory in which the extension will spawn a dedicated
Biome LSP server. The extension will implicitly create a project for every workspace folder in workspace (unless disabled), but
you can explicitly define projects using the `biome.projects` setting.

Projects give you the flexibility to setup Biome pretty much however you want, while still benefiting from sane
defaults.

### Implicit projects

Whether you open VS Code in _single-root_ or _multi-root_ mode, the extension will implicitly create a 
project for every workspace folder in the workspace,  unless projects have been explicitly registered 
for a given workspace folder.

Given the following workspace configuration, the extension will create two independent projects.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- projects
  - project-a/
  - project-b/
- foo.code-workspace
</FileTree>

```json file=foo.code-workspace
{
	"folders": [
		{
			"name": "Project A",
			"path": "projects/project-a"
		},
		{
			"name": "Project B",
			"path": "projects/project-b"
		}
	]
}
```

### Explicit projects

Projects can be explicitly defined using the `biome.projects` setting. This setting should be an array of objects, 
each of which defines a project. The following properties are supported:

- `name`: The **name of the workspace folder** that the project is associated with.
- `path`: The **path to the project directory**, _relative to the root of the workspace folder_.

The following example shows how to explicitly define the two projects used in the previous section.

```json title="foo.code-workspace"
{
	"folders": [
		{
			"path": "projects/project-a"
		},
		{
			"path": "projects/project-b"
		}
	],
	"settings": {
		"biome.projects": [
			{
				"name": "Project A",
				"path": "."
			},
			{
				"name": "Project B",
				"path": "."
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Projects are not constrained to the root of the workspace folder. You can also create projects for
subfolders of a workspace folder. Here's an example illustrating a monorepo setup where we create
independent projects for each package.

<FileTree>
- .vscode/
	- settings.json
- packages
  - foo/
    - src/
	- biome.json
  - bar/
    - src/
	- biome.json
</FileTree>

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
	"biome.projects": [
		{
			"path": "packages/foo"
		},
		{
			"path": "packages/bar"
		}
	]
}
```
