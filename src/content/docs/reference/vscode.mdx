**Biome** ships with a first-party **VS Code extension** that provides the following 
features.

- Format on save
- Real-time code linting
- Code refactoring with quick fixes

In this document, we'll go over how to install and configure the extension.

## Installing the extension

The extension is available both on the 
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) and the 
[Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/biomejs/biome) and can be installed directly
by clicking one of the following links:

## Projects

The Biome extension operates on so-called _projects_. A project is a directory in which the extension will spawn a dedicated
Biome LSP server. This is useful because it allows you to use different versions of Biome for different projects, and to
have different configurations for each project.

### Defining projects

Projects can be defined in two places:

- At the **workspace** level (`.code-workspace`)
- At the **workspace folder** level (`.vscode/settings.json`)

:::note[Implicit projects]
The extension automatically creates a project at the root of every workspace folder that does not have explicitly defined projects.
:::

#### Defining projects in a workspace

To define projects in a **workspace**, add a `settings.biome.projects` property to the `.code-workspace` file. This setting accepts an
array of project definitions, each of which has the following properties:

- `name`: The **name of the workspace folder** that the project is associated with
- `path` : The **path to the project directory**, _relative to the root of the workspace folder_.

Please refer to the [`biome.projects` config reference](#biomeprojects) for more details.

#### Defining projects in a workspace folder

To define projects in a **workspace folder**, add a `biome.projects` property to the `.vscode/settings.json` file. This setting accepts an
array of project definitions, each of which has the following properties:

- `path`: The **path to the project directory**, _relative to the root of the workspace folder_.

Please refer to the [`biome.projects` config reference](#biomeprojects) for more details.

### Enabling and disabling

The extension is always enabled because it needs to keep track of the state of the workspace, however the it provides two settings
to control whether Biome LSP sessions should be created for indidividual projects:

- The [`biome.enabled`](#biomeenabled) setting, which can be set globally and per-project.
- The [`biome.requireConfigFile`](#biomerequireconfigfile) setting, which can be set globally and per-project.

#### Using the `biome.enabled` setting

As mentioned above, the [`biome.enabled`](#biomeenabled) setting can be set globally and per-project. When setting it globally, it applies to all workspace folders, unless
they themselves override the setting. This allows you to enable or disable the extension for all workspace folders, or selectively enable or disable it for
specific workspace folders. 

#### Using the `biome.requireConfigFile` setting

The [`biome.requireConfigFile`](#biomerequireconfigfile) setting can be set globally and per-project. When setting it globally, it applies to all workspace folders, unless
they themselves override the setting. This allows you to require the presence of a [Biome configuration file](/guides/configure-biome#configuration-file-structure) for a Biome project to be enabled. 

It is a good idea to enable this setting globally when you know you always use a `biome.json` file, and you want to avoid the extension creating projects
for workspace folders that don't use Biome. 

## Common use cases

### Single-root workspaces

A single-root workspace is your typical VS Code workspace, where there is only one workspace folder. Unless told otherwise, the extension will
automatically create a project at the root of the workspace folder. This is the most common use case.

<FileTree>
- src/
  - main.ts
- biome.json
- package.json
</FileTree>

### Multi-root workspaces

A multi-root workspace is a workspace where there are multiple workspace folders. In this case, the extension will automatically create a project
at the root of each workspace folder. You can [explicitly define projects](##defining-projects-in-a-workspace) using the [`biome.projects`](#biomeprojects) 
setting.

<FileTree>
- api/ (workspace folder)
	- biome.json
	- src/
		- main.ts
- app/ (workspace folder)
	- biome.json
	- src/
		- main.ts
- my.code-workspace
</FileTree>

### Monorepos

A monorepo is typically a workspace folder in which multiple Biome projects are defined. In this case, you'll need to
[explicitly define projects](#defining-projects-in-a-workspace-folder) using the [`biome.projects`](#biomeprojects) 
setting.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="File structure">
		<FileTree>
		- .vscode/
			- settings.json  &larr; projects defined in here
		- packages/
		- foo/
			- src/
			- main.ts
			- biome.json
		- bar/
			- src/
			- main.ts
			- biome.json
		</FileTree>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label=".vscode/settings.json">
		```json
		{
			"biome.projects": [
				{
					"path": "packages/foo"
				},
				{
					"path": "packages/bar"
				}
			]
		}
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Settings reference

The following settings are available for the extension.

:::note[Settings precedence]
All settings are resolved using VS Code's [settings precedence](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-precedence) rules.
This means that the value of the setting at the most specific level will be used. This allows you to set a global setting, and override it for specific
workspace folders.
:::

### `biome.enabled`

**Default:** `true` | **Scopes:** `global`, `workspace`, `workspace folder`

This setting controls whether projects will be created in a workspace or not. When set globally, it applies to all workspace folders, unless they themselves override the setting.

### `biome.requireConfigFile`

**Default:** `false` | **Scopes:** `global`, `workspace`, `workspace folder`

This setting controls whether projects will be created depending on whether a Biome configuration file is present in the project directory. When set globally, it applies to all workspace folders, unless they themselves override the setting.

### `biome.projects`

**Default:** `undefined` | **Scopes:** `workspace`, `workspace folder`

This setting allows you to define projects explicitly. It should be an array of project definitions, whose shape depends on the scope of the setting:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="workspace folder">
		- `path` (optional, defaults to `.`): The **path to the project directory**, _relative to the root of the workspace folder_. This is the path where the extension will spawn an independant Biome LSP server, and where you'd typically
		put your `biome.json` file.
		- `configFile` (optional): The path to a **custom configuration** file to use for the project. This is useful if you want to rename the `biome.json` file, for example. By default, the LSP server will look for a `biome.{json,jsonc}` file in the
		root of the project directory.
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="workspace">
		- `name` (required when defining at the workspace level): The **name of the workspace folder** that the project is associated with, which must match the `name` property of the workspace folder defined in the `folders` property.
		- `path` (optional, defaults to `.`): The **path to the project directory**, _relative to the root of the workspace folder_. This is the path where the extension will spawn an independant Biome LSP server, and where you'd typically
		put your `biome.json` file.
		- `configFile` (optional): The path to a **custom configuration** file to use for the project. This is useful if you want to rename the `biome.json` file, for example. By default, the LSP server will look for a `biome.{json,jsonc}` file in the
		root of the project directory.
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `biome.lsp.bin`

**Default:** `undefined` | **Scopes:** `global`, `workspace`, `workspace folder`

This setting allows you to override the path to the `biome` binary. This is useful if you want to use a different version of Biome, 
or if you want to use a binary that's not on your `PATH`. In can be either a path to a binary, or an object that maps a platform to a path.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="string">
		```json
		{
			"biome.lsp.bin": "/path/to/biome"
		}
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="object">

		When using an object, the key is the platform identifier, constructed from the `<process.os>-<process.arch>` value, and the value is the path to the binary.
		```json
		{
			"biome.lsp.bin": {
				"darwin-arm64": "/path/to/biome",
				"win32-x64": "/path/to/biome.exe"
			}
		}
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `biome.lsp.trace.server`

**Default:** `off` | **Scopes:** `global`

This setting allows to set the logging level of the Biome LSP trace. The possible values are `off`, `messages`, `verbose`.
You may want to set this setting to `verbose` when you encounter issues with the extension, and you'd like to share the logs with us.

### `biome.experimental.rename` <Badge text="experimental" variant="caution" size="medium" />

**Default:** `false` | **Scopes:** `global`, `workspace`, `workspace folder`

This **experimental** setting control whether Biome should be used to rename symbols when using the `Rename Symbol` command.
