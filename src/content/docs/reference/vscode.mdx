description: Notes about the Biome's VSCode extension
---

**Biome** ships with a first-party **VS Code extension** that provides the following 
features.

- Format on save
- Real-time code linting
- Code refactoring with quick fixes

In this document, we'll go over how to install and configure the extension.

## Installing the extension

The extension is available both on the 
[VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) and the 
[Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/biomejs/biome) and can be installed directly
by clicking one of the following links:

## Configuration reference

The following sections describe the configuration options available in the extension.

### `biome.enabled`

The `biome.enabled` setting controls whether the extension is enabled or not. By default,
the extension is enabled.

The `biome.enabled` setting controls whether the extension is enabled or not. By default, 
the extension is enabled. This setting can be set at various levels, including globally,
workspace, and folder.

VS Code's [setting precedence rules](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-precedence) apply, 
so if you set the `biome.enabled` setting to `false` at the workspace level, the extension 
will be disabled for all folders in the workspace, but you can override this setting at the 
folder level.

### `biome.requireConfigFile`

The `biome.requireConfigFile` setting controls whether the extension requires a `biome.{json,jsonc}`
file to be present at the root of a project in order to enable the extension for that project. By default,
the extension does not require a configuration file to be present.

If you always explicitly create a configuration, this setting can be handy to ensure that the extension
is only enabled for Biome projects, an not others.

### `biome.lsp.bin`

The `biome.lsp.bin` setting allows you to specify the path to the `Biome` binary that the extension
should use to run the language server. By default, the extension will attempt to use the `biome` binary
provided by your dependencies. When this setting is set, the discovery mechanism will be bypassed and
the specified binary will be used instead.

```json title="settings.json"
{
	"biome.lsp.bin": "path/to/biome"
}
```

This setting can also be specified as an object, allowing you to specify the path to the binary for
different platforms. The keys of the object should be a valid combo (`{platform}-{arch}`) of a platform and an architecture
identifier as defined by the Node.js [`process.platform`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform) 
and [`process.arch`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_arch) values. The value of the object should be
the path to the binary for that platform and architecture.

```json title="settings.json"
{
	"biome.lsp.bin": {
		"linux-x64": "path/to/biome-linux",
		"darwin-x64": "path/to/biome-darwin",
		"win32-x64": "path/to/biome-win32.exe"
	}
}
