## Description
Require switch-case statements to be exhaustive.

When working with union types in TypeScript, it's common to want to write a switch statement
intended to contain a case for each possible variant.
However, if the union type changes, it's easy to forget to modify the cases to account for
any new types.

This rule reports when a switch statement over a value typed as a union of literals lacks
a case for any of those literal types and does not have a default clause.

## Examples

### Invalid

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

declare const day: Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
}
```

### Valid

```ts
type Day =
  | 'Monday'
  | 'Tuesday'
  | 'Wednesday'
  | 'Thursday'
  | 'Friday'
  | 'Saturday'
  | 'Sunday';

declare const day: Day;
let result = 0;

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    result = 1;
    break;
  case 'Tuesday':
    result = 2;
    break;
  case 'Wednesday':
    result = 3;
    break;
  case 'Thursday':
    result = 4;
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    result = 5;
    break;
  case 'Saturday':
    result = 6;
    break;
  case 'Sunday':
    result = 7;
    break;
}
```
