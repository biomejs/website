Enforce naming conventions for JavaScript and TypeScript filenames.

Enforcing [naming conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) helps to keep the codebase consistent.

A filename consists of two parts: a name and a set of consecutive extensions.
For instance, `my-filename.test.js` has `my-filename` as name, and two consecutive extensions: `.test` and `.js`.

By default, the rule ensures that the name is either in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case),
or equal to the name of one export in the file.
By default, the rule ensures that the extensions are either in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), or [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

The rule supports the following exceptions:

- The name of the file can start with a dot or a plus sign, be prefixed and suffixed by underscores `_`.
For example, `.filename.js`, `+filename.js`, `__filename__.js`, or even `.__filename__.js`.

The convention of prefixing a filename with a plus sign is used by [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page) and [Vike](https://vike.dev/route).


- Also, the rule supports dynamic route syntaxes of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments), [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#renaming-index), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route), and [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#rest-parameters).
For example `[...slug].js` and `[[...slug]].js` are valid filenames.



Note that if you specify the \`match' option, the previous exceptions will no longer be handled.

## Ignoring some files

Sometimes you want to completely ignore some files.
Biome ignore comments cannot be used because the rule applies on filenames not file contents.
To ignore files, you can use [`overrides`](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#overrides).
If you want to ignore all files in the `test` directory, then you can disable the rule for those files only:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
       "include": ["test/**/*"],
       "linter": {
         "rules": {
           "style": {
             "useFilenamingConvention": "off"
           }
         }
       }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Options

The rule provides several options that are detailed in the following subsections.

```json5
{
    "//": "...",
    "options": {
        "strictCase": false,
        "requireAscii": true,
        "match": "%?(.+?)[.](.+)", // Since v2.0.0
        "filenameCases": ["camelCase", "export"]
    }
}
```

### strictCase

When this option is set to `true`, it forbids consecutive uppercase characters in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and [`PascalCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
For instance,  when the option is set to `true`, `agentID` will throw an error.
This name should be renamed to `agentId`.

When the option is set to `false`, consecutive uppercase characters are allowed.
`agentID` is so valid.

Default: `true`

### requireAscii

When this option is set to `true`, it forbids names that include non-ASCII characters.
For instance,  when the option is set to `true`, `café` or `안녕하세요` will throw an error.

When the option is set to `false`, a name may include non-ASCII characters.
`café` and `안녕하세요` are so valid.

Default: `false`

**This option will be turned on by default in Biome 2.0.**

### match (Since v2.0.0)

`match` defines a regular expression that the filename must match.
If the regex has capturing groups, then the first capture is considered as the filename
and the second one as file extensions separated by dots.

For example, given the regular expression `%?(.+?)\.(.+)` and the filename `%index.d.ts`,
the filename matches the regular expression with two captures: `index` and `d.ts`.
The captures are checked against `filenameCases`.
Note that we use the non-greedy quantifier `+?` to stop capturing as soon as we met the next character (`.`).
If we use the greedy quantifier `+` instead, then the captures could be `index.d` and `ts`.

The regular expression supports the following syntaxes:

- Greedy quantifiers `*`, `?`, `+`, `{n}`, `{n,m}`, `{n,}`, `{m}`
- Non-greedy quantifiers `*?`, `??`, `+?`, `{n}?`, `{n,m}?`, `{n,}?`, `{m}?`
- Any character matcher `.`
- Character classes `[a-z]`, `[xyz]`, `[^a-z]`
- Alternations `|`
- Capturing groups `()`
- Non-capturing groups `(?:)`
- Case-insensitive groups `(?i:)` and case-sensitive groups `(?-i:)`
- A limited set of escaped characters including all special characters
and regular string escape characters `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v`

### filenameCases

By default, the rule enforces that the filename  is either in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), or equal to the name of one export in the file.

You can enforce a stricter convention by setting `filenameCases` option.
`filenameCases` accepts an array of cases among the following cases: [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), [`PascalCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), and `export`.

This option also applies to the file extensions.
Extensions in lowercase are always allowed regardless of how `filenameCases` is set.
