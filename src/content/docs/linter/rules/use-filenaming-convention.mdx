Enforce naming conventions for JavaScript and TypeScript filenames.

Enforcing [naming conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) helps to keep the codebase consistent.

A filename consists of two parts: a name and a set of consecutive extension.
For instance, `my-filename.test.js` has `my-filename` as name, and two consecutive extensions: `.test` and `.js`.

The filename can start with a dot or a plus sign, be prefixed and suffixed by underscores `_`.
For example, `.filename.js`, `+filename.js`, `__filename__.js`, or even `.__filename__.js`.

The convention of prefixing a filename with a plus sign is used by
[Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page) and [Vike](https://vike.dev/route).

Also, the rule supports dynamic route syntaxes of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments), [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#renaming-index), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route), and [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#rest-parameters).
For example `[...slug].js` and `[[...slug]].js` are valid filenames.

By default, the rule ensures that the filename is either in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case),
or equal to the name of one export in the file.

## Ignoring some files

Sometimes you want to completely ignore some files.
Biome ignore comments cannot be used because the rule applies on filenames not file contents.
To ignore files, you can use [`overrides`](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#overrides).
If you want to ignore all files in the `test` directory, then you can disable the rule for those files only:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
       "include": ["test/**/*"],
       "linter": {
         "rules": {
           "style": {
             "useFilenamingConvention": "off"
           }
         }
       }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Options

The rule provides several options that are detailed in the following subsections.

```json
{
    "//": "...",
    "options": {
        "strictCase": false,
        "requireAscii": true,
        "filenameCases": ["camelCase", "export"]
    }
}
```

### strictCase

When this option is set to `true`, it forbids consecutive uppercase characters in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and [`PascalCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
For instance,  when the option is set to `true`, `agentID` will throw an error.
This name should be renamed to `agentId`.

When the option is set to `false`, consecutive uppercase characters are allowed.
`agentID` is so valid.

Default: `true`

### requireAscii

When this option is set to `true`, it forbids names that include non-ASCII characters.
For instance,  when the option is set to `true`, `café` or `안녕하세요` will throw an error.

When the option is set to `false`, a name may include non-ASCII characters.
`café` and `안녕하세요` are so valid.

Default: `false`

**This option will be turned on by default in Biome 2.0.**

### filenameCases

By default, the rule enforces that the filename  is either in [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), or equal to the name of one export in the file.

You can enforce a stricter convention by setting `filenameCases` option.
`filenameCases` accepts an array of cases among the following cases: [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`kebab-case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), [`PascalCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), and `export`.
