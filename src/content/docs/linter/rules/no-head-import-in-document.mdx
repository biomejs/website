## Description
Prevent using the `next/head` module in `pages/_document.js` on Next.js projects.

Importing `next/head` within the custom `pages/_document.js` file can cause
unexpected behavior in your application. The `next/head` component is designed
to be used at the page level, and when used in the custom document it can interfere
with the global document structure, which leads to issues with rendering and SEO.

To modify `<head>` elements across all pages, you should use the `<Head />`
component from the `next/document` module.

## Examples

### Valid

```jsx
// pages/_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    //...
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head></Head>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

## How to configure
```json title="biome.json"
{
	"linter": {
		"rules": {
			"nursery": {
				"noHeadImportInDocument": "error"
			}
		}
	}
}

```
