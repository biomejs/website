## Summary
:::note
This rule is currently only available in the [2.0 beta release](/blog/biome-v2-0-beta).
:::
- Diagnostic Category: [`lint/correctness/noPrivateImports`](/reference/diagnostics#diagnostic-category)
- This rule is **recommended**, which means is enabled by default.
- This rule doesn't have a fix.
- The default severity of this rule is [**information**](/reference/diagnostics#information).
- Sources: 
  - Same as [`import-access/eslint-plugin-import-access`](https://github.com/uhyo/eslint-plugin-import-access)

## Description
Restrict imports of private exports.

In JavaScript and TypeScript, as soon as you `export` a symbol, such as
a type, function, or anything else that can be exported, it is
considered public and can be imported from anywhere else. Unfortunately,
this makes it hard to enforce module boundaries, or to prevent importing
things that were only exported for test purposes, for instance.

This rule recognizes the JSDoc tags `@public`, `@package`, and
`@private` so that you are free to set the visibility of exports.
Exports without tag have a default visibility of **public**, but  this
can be configured.

The `@access` tag is also supported if it's used with one of the values
`public`, `package`, or `private`.

## Public visibility

Public visibility is the default and means there are no restrictions for
importing a given symbol. In other words, without this rule, all
exported symbols are implicitly public.

## Package visibility

Within the context of this rule, _package visibility_ means that a
symbol is visible within the same "package", which means that any module
that resides in the same folder, or one of its subfolders, is allowed to
import the symbol. Modules that only share a common folder higher up in
the hierarchy are not allowed to import the symbol.

For a visual explanation, see
[this illustration](https://github.com/uhyo/eslint-plugin-import-access?tab=readme-ov-file#what).

## Private visibility

Private visibility means that a symbol may not be imported from other
modules.

The key thing to understanding the usefulness of `@private` is that
this rule doesn't treat modules and files as one and the same thing.
While files are indeed modules, folders are considered modules too, with
their files and subfolders being submodules. Therefore, symbols exported
as `@private` from an index file, such as `index.js`, can _still_ be
imported from other submodules in that same module.

:::note
For the sake of compatibility with conventions used with Deno, modules
named `mod.js`/`mod.ts` are considered index files too.
:::

Another reason why private visibility may still be useful is that it
allows you to choose specific exceptions. For example, using
[overrides](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#overrides), you
may want to disable this rule in all files with a `.test.js` extension.
This way, symbols marked private cannot be imported from outside
modules, with the exception of test files.

## Known Limitations

- This rule only applies to imports from JavaScript and TypeScript
files. Imports for resources such as images or CSS files are exempted
regardless of the default visibility setting.
- This rule does not validate imports through dynamic `import()`
expressions or CommonJS `require()` calls.

## Examples

### Invalid

**`sub/foo.js`**

```js
/**
 * @package
 */
export const fooPackageVariable = 1;
```

**`bar.js`**

```js
// Attempt to import package private variable from `sub/foo.js` from
// outside its `sub` module:
import { fooPackageVariable } from "./sub/foo.js";

/**
 * @private For test purposes only!
 */
export function getTestStuff() {}
```

**`bar.test.js`**
// Attempt to import a private export. To allow this, you probably want
// to configure an `override` to disable this rule in test files.
// See: https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#overrides

```js
import { getTestStuff } from "./bar.js";
```

### Valid

**`sub/index.js`**

```js
// Package-private exports can be imported from inside the same module.
import { fooPackageVariable } from "./foo.js";

// Resources (anything other than JS/TS files) are always exempt.
import { barResource } from "../resources/bar.png";

/** @private */
export const subPrivateVariable = 2;
```

**`sub/deep/index.js`**

```js
// Private exports are accessible within the same module only, but
// modules can be nested. So the following works because you can always
// import from the index file of a parent module:
import { subPrivateVariable } from "../index.js";
```

## How to configure
```json title="biome.json"
{
	"linter": {
		"rules": {
			"correctness": {
				"noPrivateImports": "error"
			}
		}
	}
}

```
