Disallow user defined types.

This rule allows you to specify type names that you donâ€™t want to use in your application.

To prevent use of commonly misleading types, you can refer to [noBannedTypes](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-banned-types/)

## Options

Use the options to specify additional types that you want to restrict in your
source code.

```json
{
    "//": "...",
    "options": {
        "types": {
           "Foo": {
              "message": "Only bar is allowed",
              "use": "bar"
            },
            "OldAPI": "Use NewAPI instead"
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, the rule will emit a diagnostics if `Foo` or `OldAPI` are used.
