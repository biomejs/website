## Description
Disallow user defined types.

This rule allows you to specify type names that you don’t want to use in your application.

To prevent use of commonly misleading types, you can refer to [noBannedTypes](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-banned-types/)

## Options

Use the options to specify additional types that you want to restrict in your
source code.

```json
{
    "options": {
        "types": {
           "Foo": {
              "message": "Only bar is allowed",
              "use": "bar"
            },
            "OldAPI": "Use NewAPI instead"
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, the rule will emit a diagnostics if `Foo` or `OldAPI` are used.

## How to configure
```json title="biome.json"

	"linter": {
