## Description
Disallow the use of configured elements.

This rule disallows the use of configured elements. Without elements configured,
this rule doesn't do anything.

This rule is useful in situations where you want to enforce the use of specific components
instead of certain HTML or custom elements. For example, in a React project,
you might want to ensure that developers use a custom `TextField` component
instead of the native `<input>` element to maintain consistency and apply
custom styling or behavior.

Here are some scenarios where this rule can be beneficial:

- Consistency: Ensuring that all input fields use a custom component instead of the native
element to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
- Accessibility: Enforcing the use of custom components that have built-in
accessibility features, ensuring that the application is accessible to all users.
- Custom Behavior: Requiring the use of components that encapsulate specific business logic
or validation, reducing the risk of errors and improving code maintainability.
- Styling: Ensuring that all elements adhere to the design system by using
custom components that apply consistent styling.

By disallowing certain elements and enforcing the use of custom components,
this rule helps maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.

## Options

```json
{
    "options": {
        "elements": {
            "input": "input is not allowed, use TextField component instead",
            "CustomComponent": "deprecated"
        }
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Invalid

Restricting the use of HTML elements:

```jsx
<input />
```

<pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text"></code></pre>

Restricting the use of custom components:

```jsx

```

<pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text"></code></pre>

### Valid

```jsx
<TextField />
```

## How to configure
```json title="biome.json"
{
	"linter": {
		"rules": {
			"nursery": {
				"noRestrictedElements": "error"
			}
		}
	}
