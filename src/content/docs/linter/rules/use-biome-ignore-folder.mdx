## Description
Promotes the correct usage for ignoring folders in the configuration file.

Starting Biome v2.2, ignoring folders doesn't require the use of the trailing `/**`.
When using the pattern `/**`, you tell Biome to ignore **all files** inside a folder, but the folder is still crawled. This pattern
can lead to poor performance, especially if the folder contains many files.

If the intention is to ignore specific files inside a folder, the trailing pattern `/**` shouldn't be used.

## Examples

### Invalid

```json
{
    "files": {
        "includes": ["**", "!dist/**", "!**/dist/**"]
    }
}
```

### Valid

```json
{
    "files": {
        "includes": ["**", "!dist", "!**/dist"]
    }
}
```
