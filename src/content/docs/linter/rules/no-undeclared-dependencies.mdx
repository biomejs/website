  Disallow the use of dependencies that aren't specified in the `package.json`.

**Since**: `v1.6.0`
Disallow the use of dependencies that aren't specified in the `package.json`.

Indirect dependencies will trigger the rule because they aren't declared in the `package.json`.
This means that if the package `@org/foo` has a dependency on `lodash`, and then you use
`import "lodash"` somewhere in your project, the rule will trigger a diagnostic for this import.

The rule ignores imports that are not valid package names.
This includes internal imports that start with `#` and `@/` and imports with a protocol such as `node:`, `bun:`, `jsr:`, `https:`.

To ensure that Visual Studio Code uses relative imports when it automatically imports a variable,
you may set [`javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier` and `typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to `relative`.

## Examples

### Invalid

```js
import "vite";
```

### Valid

```js
import { A } from "./local.js";
```

```js
import assert from "node:assert";
```
