Below the list of rules supported by Biome, divided by group. Here's a legend of the emojis:
- The icon <span class='inline-icon' title="This rule is recommended"><Icon name="approve-check-circle" label="This rule is recommended" /></span> indicates that the rule is part of the recommended rules.
- The icon <span class='inline-icon' title="This rule has a safe fix"><Icon name="seti:config" label="The rule has a safe fix" /></span> indicates that the rule provides a code action (fix) that is **safe** to apply.
- The icon <span class='inline-icon' title="This rule has an unsafe fix"><Icon name="warning" label="The rule has an unsafe fix" /></span> indicates that the rule provides a code action (fix) that is **unsafe** to apply.
- The icon <span class='inline-icon' title="This rule is not released yet"><Icon name="moon" label="This rule is not released yet" /></span> indicates that the rule has been implemented and scheduled for the next release.
