- The icon <span class='inline-icon' title="This rule has a safe fix"><Icon name="seti:config" label="The rule has a safe fix" /></span> indicates that the rule provides a code action (fix) that is **safe** to apply.
- The icon <span class='inline-icon' title="This rule has an unsafe fix"><Icon name="warning" label="The rule has an unsafe fix" /></span> indicates that the rule provides a code action (fix) that is **unsafe** to apply.
