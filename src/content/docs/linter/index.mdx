Biome's linter statically analyzes your code to find and fix common errors and to help you write better, modern code.
It [supports multiple languages](/internals/language-support) and provides a total of [**<NumberOfRules/> rules**](/linter/rules/).


## CLI

The following command runs the linter on all files in the `src` directory:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint ./src" />

The command accepts a list of files and directories.

:::caution
If you pass a glob as a parameter, your shell will expand it.
The result of the expansion depends on your shell.
For example, some shells don't support the recursive glob `**` or the alternation `{}` in the following command:

```shell
biome lint ./src/**/*.test.{js,ts}
```

Shell expansion has a performance cost and a limit on the number of files you can pass to the command.

For more information about all the available options, check the [CLI reference](/reference/cli#biome-lint).


## Rules

The linter is organized into rules.
A rule emits a diagnostic when it encounters a code that doesn't meet its requirements.
For example, the [noDebugger](http://localhost:4321/linter/rules/no-debugger) rule reports using the `debugger` instruction in JavaScript code.

A rule emits diagnostics with a `warn` or `error` severity.
Diagnostics with an `error` severity cause the command to exit with a non-zero code,
While diagnostics with a `warn` severity don't cause the command to fail.
You can turn warnings into errors `--error-on-warnings` CLI option:

```shell
biome lint --error-on-warnings ./src
```

By default, the Biome linter only runs [**recommended rules**](/linter/rules#recommended-rules).
To disable _all rules_, you can disable the recommended rules in your Biome configuration file.
This may be useful in cases when you want to enable only a few rules.
Recommended rules emit diagnostics with the `error` severity.

Rules are organized into groups.
For example, the `noDebugger` rule is part of the [`suspicious` group](/linter/rules#suspicious).
A Rule from this group detects code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.
The description of each group can be found on the [rules page](/linter/rules/).

Unlike other linters, we don't provide any rules that check for code formatting.
This kind of checking is covered by our [code formatter](/formatter/).

Many rules provide a **code fix** that can be automatically applied.
Biome distinguishes between **safe** and **unsafe** code fixes.

### Safe fixes

Safe fixes are guaranteed to not change the semantic of your code.
They can be applied without explicit review.

To apply _safe fixes_, use `--apply`:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --apply ./src" />

### Unsafe fixes

Unsafe fixes may change the semantic of your program.
Therefore, it's advised to manually review the changes.

To apply _unsafe fixes_, use `--apply-unsafe`:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --apply-unsafe ./src" />

Note that this command also applies safe fixes.

### Rule pillars

We believe that rules should be informative and explain to the user why a rule is triggered and tell the user what they should to do fix the error.
A rule should follow these **pillars**:

1. Explain to the user the error. Generally, this is the message of the diagnostic.
2. Explain to the user **why** the error is triggered. Generally, this is implemented with an additional node.
3. Tell the user what they should do. Generally, this is implemented using a code action.
   If a code action is not applicable a note should tell the user what they should do to fix the error.

If you think a rule doesn't follow these pillars,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/new?assignees=&labels=S-To+triage&projects=&template=01_bug.yml&title=%F0%9F%90%9B+%3CTITLE%3E).


## Configuration

A rule is enabled whether its severity is `error` or `warn`.
You can turn off a rule with `off`.

The following configuration disables the recommended `noDebugger` rule
and enables the `noShoutyConstants` and `useNamingConvention` rules.
The `warn` severity is useful in cases where there's a refactor going on and there's a need to make the CI pass.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "suspicious": {
        "noDebugger": "off"
      },
      "style": {
        "noShoutyConstants": "warn",
        "useNamingConvention": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Rule options

A few rules have options.
You can set them by shaping the value of the rule differently.

- `level` will indicate the severity of the diagnostic;
- `options` will change based on the rule.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "useNamimgConvention": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "strictCase": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Ignoring code

There are times when a developer wants to ignore a lint rule for a specific line of the code.
You can achieve this by adding a suppression comment above the line that emits the lint diagnostic.

Suppression comments have the following format:

```js
// biome-ignore lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: <explanation>
```

Where

- `biome-ignore` is the start of a suppression comment;
- `lint` suppresses the linter;
- `/suspicious/noDebugger`: **optional**, group and name of the rule you want to suppress;
- `<explanation>` explanation why the rule is disabled

Here's an example:

```ts
// biome-ignore lint: reason
debugger;
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger;
```


## Ignoring files

Biome doesn't provide ignore comments that ignore an entire file.
However, you can ignore a file using the Biome configuration file.

You can ignore files for all tools, including the linter,
using the [`files.ignore` configuration](/guides/how-biome-works#include-and-ignore-explained).
By default, Biome ignores the [protected files](/guides/how-biome-works#protected-files).

If you want to exclude files from being linted, you can use `linter.ignore`:

```json title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "files": {
    // All tools, including the linter, ignore following files
    "ignore": ["dist/**"]
  },
  "linter": {
    // Only the linter ignores the following files
    "ignore": ["test/**"]
  }
}
```

Note that you can also [ignore the files ignored by your VCS](/guides/integrate-in-vcs#use-the-ignore-file).


## Migrating from other linters

Many of Biome lint rules are inspired from other linters.
If you want to migrate from other linters such as ESLint or `typescript-eslint`,
check the [rules sources page](/linter/rules-sources)
If you are migrating from ESLint,
we have a dedicated [migration guide](/guides/migrate-eslint-prettier#migrate-from-eslint).
