Biome's linter statically analyzes your code to find and fix common errors and to help you write better, modern code.
It [supports multiple languages](/internals/language-support) and provides a total of [**<NumberOfRules/> rules**](/linter/rules/).


The following command runs the linter on all files from the root of your project:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint" />

Or you can specify one or multiple folders, for example `./src` and `./public`

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint ./src ./public" />

The command accepts a list of files and directories.

:::caution
If you pass a glob as a parameter, your shell will expand it. **Biome doesn't support globs**.
The result of the expansion depends on your shell.
For example, some shells don't support the recursive glob `**` or the alternation `{}` in the following command:

```shell
biome lint ./src/**/*.test.{js,ts}
```

Shell expansion has a performance cost and a limit on the number of files you can pass to the command.

The use of globs is **discouraged**, instead use the `includes` configuration.
:::

For more information about all the available options, check the [CLI reference](/reference/cli#biome-lint).

## Rules

The linter is organized into rules.
A rule emits a diagnostic when it encounters a code that doesn't meet its requirements.
For example, the [noDebugger](/linter/rules/no-debugger) rule reports the use of the `debugger` statements in JavaScript code.

Biome linter ships with a set of recommended rules that varies based on languages, which are enabled by default when you avail of the default Biome configuration (or no-configuration) when you run the `lint` or `check` command:

```shell
biome lint
```

Each lint rule ships with a default [severity](/diagnostics#diagnostic-severity), which you can learn about from the documentation of each rule.

The rules are divided into [groups](#linter-groups). For example, the `noDebugger` rule is part of the [`suspicious` group](#suspicious).

You can cause a command that emits `warn` diagnostics to fail by using the `--error-on-warnings` option:

```shell
biome lint --error-on-warnings ./src
```

To disable _all rules_, you can disable the recommended rules in your Biome configuration file.
This may be useful in cases when you only want to enable a few rules.



Unlike other linters, we don't provide any rules that check for code formatting.
This kind of checking is covered by our [code formatter](/formatter/).

Many rules provide a **code fix** that can be automatically applied.
Biome distinguishes between **safe** and **unsafe** code fixes.

## Safe fixes

Safe fixes are guaranteed to not change the semantic of your code.
They can be applied without explicit review.

To apply _safe fixes_, use `--write`:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --write ./src" />

## Unsafe fixes

Unsafe fixes may change the semantic of your program.
Therefore, it's advised to manually review the changes.

To apply both _safe fixes_ and _unsafe fixes_, use `--write --unsafe`:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --write --unsafe ./src" />

## Rule pillars

We believe that rules should be informative and explain to the user why a rule is triggered and tell the user what they should to do fix the error.
A rule should follow these **pillars**:

1. Explain to the user the error. Generally, this is the message of the diagnostic.
2. Explain to the user **why** the error is triggered. Generally, this is implemented with an additional node.
3. Tell the user what they should do. Generally, this is implemented using a code action.
If a code action is not applicable a note should tell the user what they should do to fix the error.

If you think a rule doesn't follow these pillars,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/new?assignees=&labels=S-To+triage&projects=&template=01_bug.yml&title=%F0%9F%90%9B+%3CTITLE%3E).

## Skip a rule or a group

The command `biome lint` accepts an option `--skip` that allows to disable a rule or rules that belong to a group.

For example, the following command skips all the rules that belong to the `style` group and the `suspicious/noExplicitAny` rule:

```shell
biome lint --skip=style --skip=suspicious/noExplicitAny
```

## Run a rule or a group

The command `biome lint` accepts an option `--only` that allows you to run a single rule or the rules that belong to a group.

For example, the following command runs only the rule`style/useNamingConvention`, the rule `style/noInferrableTypes` and the rules that belong to `a11y`. If the rule is disabled in the configuration, then its severity level is set to `error` for a recommended rule or `warn` otherwise.

```shell
biome lint --only=style/useNamingConvention --only=style/noInferrableTypes --only=a11y
```

## Disable a rule

You can turn off a rule with `off`.

The following configuration disables the recommended rule `noDebugger`:

```json title="biome.json" ins="\"off\""
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "suspicious": {
        "noDebugger": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Rule severity

Biome lint rules are shipped with their own default severity. If you want to avail of rule default severity, you can use the `"on"` configuration:

For example the `noShoutyConstants` isn't recommended by default, and when it's triggered in emits a diagnostic with information severity.

If you're happy with this default and you want to avail of it, the configuration will look like this:

```json title="biome.json" ins="\"on\""
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "noShoutyConstants": "on"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you aren't happy with the default severity, Biome allows you to change it with `"error"`, `"warn"` and `"info"`

The [`"error"`](/reference/diagnostics#error) severity is useful when you want to block the CI if there's a violation that belongs to a certain rule.

The [`warn`](/reference/diagnostics#warning) severity is useful in cases where there's a refactor going on and there's a need to make the CI pass.  You can use `--error-on-warnings` to exit with an error code when a rule configured with `warn` is triggered.

The [`info`](/reference/diagnostics#information) severity won't affect the exit status code of the CLI, even when `--error-on-warnings` is passed.


## Configure the rule fix

It's possible to configure the entity of a fix, using the option `fix`.
There are three options:

- `none`: the rule won't emit a code fix;
- `safe`: the rule will emit a [safe fix](#safe-fixes);
- `unsafe`: the rule will emit an [unsafe fix](#unsafe-fixes);

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "correctness": {
        "noUnusedVariables": {
          "level": "error",
          "fix": "none"
        }
      },
      "style": {
        "useConst": {
          "level": "warn",
          "fix": "unsafe"
        },
        "useTemplate": {
          "level": "warn",
          "fix": "safe"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Rule options

A few rules have options.
You can set them by shaping the value of the rule differently.

- `level` will indicate the severity of the diagnostic;
- `options` will change based on the rule.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "useNamingConvention": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "strictCase": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Linter Groups

The linter divides rules under _groups_. Groups are meant to offer some sort of category which rules falls under. This information becomes useful, for users, when choosing a rule to enable/disable, or for developers when creating new lint rules.

### Accessibility

Rules focused on preventing accessibility problems.

### Complexity
Rules that focus on inspecting complex code that could be simplified.

### Correctness
Rules that detect code that is guaranteed to be incorrect or useless.

### Nursery
New rules that are still under development.  Nursery rules require explicit opt-in via configuration on stable versions because they may still have bugs or performance problems. They are enabled by default on nightly builds, but as they are unstable their diagnostic severity may be set to either error or warning, depending on whether we intend for the rule to be recommended or not when it eventually gets stabilized. Nursery rules get promoted to other groups once they become stable or may be removed.  Rules that belong to this group are not subject to semantic version.

### Performance
Rules catching ways your code could be written to run faster, or generally be more efficient.

### Security
Rules that detect potential security flaws.

### Style
Rules enforcing a consistent and idiomatic way of writing your code. This rules, by design, *will never emit errors* unless configured otherwise.

### Suspicious
Rules that detect code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.

## Suppress lint rules

There are times when a developer wants to suppress a lint rule for a specific line of the code, more lines of code, or the entire file.

Biome provide different ways suppress lint rule using specific comments called **suppression comments**.

:::note
From here onwards, JavaScript is used to explain suppression comments, but they are valid in every language supported by Biome.
:::

Suppression comments have the following format:

```js
// biome-ignore lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger(foo): <explanation>
// biome-ignore-all lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore-start lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore-end lint: <explanation>
```

Let's break it down:

- `biome-ignore`, `biome-ignore-all`, `biome-ignore-start` and `biome-ignore-end` are the start of a suppression comment'
- `lint` is the **category** of the suppression comment, and in this case it suppresses the linter;
- `/suspicious/noDebugger` or `/suspicious`: **optional**, group and name, or group of the rule you want to suppress;
- `(foo)`: **optional**, values associated to the suppression comment, these values are used by the specific rules. Refer to the documentation
of the single rule to learn if they are used.
- `<explanation>` explanation why the rule is disabled


### Inline suppressions

They disable a lint rule for the **next line** of code.

The following example, the suppression comment `biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` will disable the `debugger;` statement at line 2, but the `debugger` at line 3 will still raise a diagnostic:

```js title="file.js" ins={1}
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger;
debugger;
```

### Top-level suppressions

They disable a lint rule for an entire file. They must be placed **at the top of the file**, and they must start with `biome-ignore-all`.

These suppression comments are very useful when you want to suppression some lint rule *for a particular file*, and you don't want to rely to a single configuration override to achieve that.

The following example, the suppression comment `biome-ignore-all lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` will disable the lint rule for the whole file `generated.js`:

```js title="generated.js" ins={1}
// biome-ignore-all lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason

debugger
debugger

```

When a top-level suppression comment isn't at the top of the file, it is considered *unused* and Biome will emit a diagnostic with category `suppression/unused`.

### Range suppressions

They disable a lint rule from a particular line of code, to another line of code, called range.

To mark the beginning of a range suppression, the suppression comment must start with `// biome-ignore-start`, and to mark the end of it, the suppression comment must start with `// biome-ignore-end`.

The following example will disable the rule `lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals` for line 2 and 3, but the line 5 will raise a diagnostic:

```js name="file.js" ins={1} ins={4}
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
a == b;
c == d;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
f == g;
```

The range suppression comments use a [FILO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) queue (First in, Last out), which means that the first range suppression encountered by Biome will be the last one to be disabled.

The following example goes more in detail:
- The `debugger` statement at line 1 will raise a diagnostic because there's no suppression comment that disables it.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` at line 2 starts disabling `noDebugger` from line 3 onwards.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason` at line 3 starts disabling `noDoubleEquals` from line 4 onwards.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason` at line 7 terminates the suppression of `noDoubleEquals` that was started by the suppression comment at line 3.
- The `debugger` statement at line 8 **doesn't** raise diagnostics due to the suppression comment at line 3.
- The `f == g` statement raises a diagnostic because the rule `noDoubleEquals` isn't suppressed anymore.
- The rule `noDebugger` is disabled for the rest of the file because there's nt `biome-ignore-end` that "closes" the suppression comment at line 2.

```js name="file.js"
debugger;
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
a == b;
c == d;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
debugger
f == g;
```

## Migrate from other linters

Many of Biome lint rules are inspired from other linters.
If you want to migrate from other linters such as ESLint or `typescript-eslint`, check the [rules sources page](/linter/rules-sources)
If you are migrating from ESLint, we have a dedicated [migration guide](/guides/migrate-eslint-prettier#migrate-from-eslint).

<Steps>

1. Use the command `biome migrate eslint` to port the rules defined in your `eslint` configuration file to `biome.json`:
    ```shell
    biome migrate eslint
    ```
2. Lint the project by suppressing possible new rules that are caught by Biome, using the following command:
    ```shell
    biome lint --write --unsafe --suppress="suppressed due to migration"
    ```
   The command will suppress all linting violation that Biome finds, using the reason `"suppressed due to migration"`. Now the linter shouldn't error anymore, and it's possible to remove the suppression comments at a later stage.
</Steps>

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> Why does rule X has an *unsafe* fix? It seems safe to me.

There are different reasons why the Biome team decides to mark a fix unsafe, but mostly it boils down to the following reasons:
- The lint rule is still under heavy development, as well as the fix.
- The rule fix can change the semantics of a program, so the fix must be opted in by the user.
- The rule fix can deteriorate the DX while typing and/or saving. An example is `noUnusedVariables`, which adds `_` to the name of unused variables. This can deteriorate the DX of programmers while typing and saving.

If a code fix doesn't follow under three guidelines, it's possible that the team forgot to make the rule fix safe. Open an issue or send a PR!
