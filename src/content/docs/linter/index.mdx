Biome's linter statically analyzes your code to find and fix common errors and to help you write better, modern code.
It [supports multiple languages](/internals/language-support) and provides a total of [**<NumberOfRules/> rules**](/linter/rules/).


## CLI

The following command runs the linter on all files from the root of your project:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint" />

Or you can specify a folder, for example `./src`

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint ./src" />

The command accepts a list of files and directories.

:::caution
If you pass a glob as a parameter, your shell will expand it.
The result of the expansion depends on your shell.
For example, some shells don't support the recursive glob `**` or the alternation `{}` in the following command:

```shell
biome lint ./src/**/*.test.{js,ts}
```

Shell expansion has a performance cost and a limit on the number of files you can pass to the command.
:::

For more information about all the available options, check the [CLI reference](/reference/cli#biome-lint).


## Rules

The linter is organized into rules.
A rule emits a diagnostic when it encounters a code that doesn't meet its requirements.
For example, the [noDebugger](/linter/rules/no-debugger) rule reports the use of the `debugger` instruction in JavaScript code.

A rule emits diagnostics with a `info`, `warn` or `error` severity.
Diagnostics with an `error` severity cause the command to exit with a non-zero code,
While diagnostics with a `info` or a `warn` severity don't cause the command to fail.

You can cause a command that emits `warn` diagnostics to fail by using the `--error-on-warnings` option:

```shell
biome lint --error-on-warnings ./src
```

By default, the Biome linter only runs the [**recommended rules**](/linter/rules#recommended-rules).
To disable _all rules_, you can disable the recommended rules in your Biome configuration file.
This may be useful in cases when you only want to enable a few rules.
The recommended rules emit diagnostics with the `error` severity.

The rules are divided into groups.
For example, the `noDebugger` rule is part of the [`suspicious` group](/linter/rules#suspicious).
Rules from this group detect code that is likely to be incorrect or useless.
The description of each group can be found on the [rules page](/linter/rules/).

Unlike other linters, we don't provide any rules that check for code formatting.
This kind of checking is covered by our [code formatter](/formatter/).

Many rules provide a **code fix** that can be automatically applied.
Biome distinguishes between **safe** and **unsafe** code fixes.

### Safe fixes

Safe fixes are guaranteed to not change the semantic of your code.
They can be applied without explicit review.

To apply _safe fixes_, use `--write`:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --write ./src" />

### Unsafe fixes

Unsafe fixes may change the semantic of your program.
Therefore, it's advised to manually review the changes.

To apply both _safe fixes_ and _unsafe fixes_, use `--write --unsafe`:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --write --unsafe ./src" />

### Rule pillars

We believe that rules should be informative and explain to the user why a rule is triggered and tell the user what they should to do fix the error.
A rule should follow these **pillars**:

1. Explain to the user the error. Generally, this is the message of the diagnostic.
2. Explain to the user **why** the error is triggered. Generally, this is implemented with an additional node.
3. Tell the user what they should do. Generally, this is implemented using a code action.
If a code action is not applicable a note should tell the user what they should do to fix the error.

If you think a rule doesn't follow these pillars,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/new?assignees=&labels=S-To+triage&projects=&template=01_bug.yml&title=%F0%9F%90%9B+%3CTITLE%3E).

### Skip a rule or a group

Since version **v1.8.0**, the command `biome lint` accepts an option `--skip` that allows to disable a rule or rules that belong to a group.

For example, the following command skips all the rules that belong to the `style` group and the `suspicious/noExplicitAny` rule:

```shell
biome lint --skip=style --skip=suspicious/noExplicitAny
```

### Run a rule or a group

Since version **v1.8.0**, the command `biome lint` accepts an option `--only` that allows you to run a single rule or the rules that belong to a group.

For example, the following command runs only the rule`style/useNamingConvention`, the rule `style/noInferrableTypes` and the rules that belong to `a11y`. If the rule is disabled in the configuration, then its severity level is set to `error` for a recommended rule or `warn` otherwise.

```shell
biome lint --only=style/useNamingConvention --only=style/noInferrableTypes --only=a11y
```

## Configuration

A rule can be configured based on your needs.

### Disable a rule

A rule is enabled whether its severity is `error`, `warn` or `info`. You can turn off a rule with `off`.

The following configuration disables the recommended `noDebugger` rule and enables the `noShoutyConstants` and `useNamingConvention` rules.

The `warn` severity is useful in cases where there's a refactor going on and there's a need to make the CI pass. The diagnostic message is yellow. You can use `--error-on-warnings` to exit with an error code when a rule configured with `warn` is triggered.

The `info` severity won't affect the exit status code of the CLI, even when `--error-on-warnings` is passed. The diagnostic message color is blue.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "suspicious": {
        "noDebugger": "off",
        "noConsoleLog": "info"
      },
      "style": {
        "noShoutyConstants": "warn",
        "useNamingConvention": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure the rule fix

Since version **v1.8.0**, it's possible to configure the entity of a fix, using the option `fix`.
There are three options:

- `none`: the rule won't emit a code fix;
- `safe`: the rule will emit a [safe fix](#safe-fixes);
- `unsafe`: the rule will emit an [unsafe fix](#unsafe-fixes);

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "correctness": {
        "noUnusedVariables": {
          "level": "error",
          "fix": "none"
        }
      },
      "style": {
        "useConst": {
          "level": "warn",
          "fix": "unsafe"
        },
        "useTemplate": {
          "level": "warn",
          "fix": "safe"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Rule options

A few rules have options.
You can set them by shaping the value of the rule differently.

- `level` will indicate the severity of the diagnostic;
- `options` will change based on the rule.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "useNamingConvention": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "strictCase": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Suppress lint rules

There are times when a developer wants to suppress a lint rule for a specific line of the code, more lines of code, or the entire file.

Biome provide different ways suppress lint rule using specific comments called **suppression comments**.

:::note
From here onwards, JavaScript is used to explain suppression comments, but they are valid in every language supported by Biome.
:::

Suppression comments have the following format:

```js
// biome-ignore lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger(foo): <explanation>
// biome-ignore-all lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore-start lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore-end lint: <explanation>
```

Let's break it down:

- `biome-ignore`, `biome-ignore-all`, `biome-ignore-start` and `biome-ignore-end` are the start of a suppression comment'
- `lint` is the **category** of the suppression comment, and in this case it suppresses the linter;
- `/suspicious/noDebugger` or `/suspicious`: **optional**, group and name, or group of the rule you want to suppress;
- `(foo)`: **optional**, values associated to the suppression comment, these values are used by the specific rules. Refer to the documentation
of the single rule to learn if they are used.
- `<explanation>` explanation why the rule is disabled


### Inline suppressions

They disable a lint rule for the **next line** of code.

The following example, the suppression comment `biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` will disable the `debugger;` statement at line 2, but the `debugger` at line 3 will still raise a diagnostic:

```js title="file.js" ins={1}
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger;
debugger;
```

### Top-level suppressions

**Since**: `v2.0.0`

They disable a lint rule for an entire file. They must be placed **at the top of the file**, and they must start with `biome-ignore-all`.

These suppression comments are very useful when you want to suppression some lint rule *for a particular file*, and you don't want to rely to a single configuration override to achieve that.

The following example, the suppression comment `biome-ignore-all lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` will disable the lint rule for the whole file `generated.js`:

```js title="generated.js" ins={1}
// biome-ignore-all lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason

debugger
debugger

```

When a top-level suppression comment isn't at the top of the file, it is considered *unused* and Biome will emit a diagnostic with category `suppression/unused`.

### Range suppressions

**Since**: `v2.0.0`

They disable a lint rule from a particular line of code, to another line of code, called range.

To mark the beginning of a range suppression, the suppression comment must start with `// biome-ignore-start`, and to mark the end of it, the suppression comment must start with `// biome-ignore-end`.

The following example will disable the rule `lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals` for line 2 and 3, but the line 5 will raise a diagnostic:

```js name="file.js" ins={1} ins={4}
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
a == b;
c == d;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
f == g;
```

The range suppression comments use a [FILO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) queue (First in, Last out), which means that the first range suppression encountered by Biome will be the last one to be disabled.

The following example goes more in detail:
- The `debugger` statement at line 1 will raise a diagnostic because there's no suppression comment that disables it.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` at line 2 starts disabling `noDebugger` from line 3 onwards.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason` at line 3 starts disabling `noDoubleEquals` from line 4 onwards.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason` at line 7 terminates the suppression of `noDoubleEquals` that was started by the suppression comment at line 3.
- The `debugger` statement at line 8 **doesn't** raise diagnostics due to the suppression comment at line 3.
- The `f == g` statement raises a diagnostic because the rule `noDoubleEquals` isn't suppressed anymore.
- The rule `noDebugger` is disabled for the rest of the file because there's nt `biome-ignore-end` that "closes" the suppression comment at line 2.

```js name="file.js"
debugger;
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
a == b;
c == d;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
debugger
f == g;
```

## Migrate from other linters

Many of Biome lint rules are inspired from other linters.
If you want to migrate from other linters such as ESLint or `typescript-eslint`, check the [rules sources page](/linter/rules-sources)
If you are migrating from ESLint, we have a dedicated [migration guide](/guides/migrate-eslint-prettier#migrate-from-eslint).


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> Why does rule X has an *unsafe* fix? It seems safe to me.

There are different reasons why the Biome team decides to mark a fix unsafe, but mostly it boils down to the following reasons:
- The lint rule is still under heavy development, as well as the fix.
- The rule fix can change the semantics of a program, so the fix must be opted in by the user.
- The rule fix can deteriorate the DX while typing and/or saving. An example is `noUnusedVariables`, which adds `_` to the name of unused variables. This can deteriorate the DX of programmers while typing and saving.

If a code fix doesn't follow under three guidelines, it's possible that the team forgot to make the rule fix safe. Open an issue or send a PR!
