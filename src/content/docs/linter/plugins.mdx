description: An overview of how to use Biome's Linter Plugins
---

:::note
Plugins are currently only available in the [2.0 beta release](/blog/biome-v2-0-beta).
:::

Biome Linter supports [GritQL](/reference/gritql/) plugins. Currently, these
plugins allow you to match specific code patterns and register customized
diagnostic messages for them.

Here is an example of a plugin that reports on all usages of `Object.assign()`:

```grit
`$fn($args)` where {
    $fn <: `Object.assign`,
    register_diagnostic(
        span = $fn,
        message = "Prefer object spread instead of `Object.assign()`"
    )
}
```

You can put a GritQL snippet in a file anywhere in your project, but be mindful
you use the `.grit` extension. Then, you can simply enable it as a plugin with
the following configuration:

```json name="biome.json"
{
    "plugins": ["./path-to-plugin.grit"]
}
```

The plugin will now be enabled on all supported files the linter runs on. You
can see its results when running `biome lint` or `biome check`. For example:

```shell
$ biome lint
/packages/tailwindcss-config-analyzer/src/introspect.ts:12:17 plugin ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ✖ Prefer object spread instead of `Object.assign()`

    10 │ function createContextFromConfig(config: Partial<Config>) {
    11 │        return createContext(
  > 12 │                resolveConfig(Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_CONFIG, config)),
       │                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    13 │        );
    14 │ }
```

## Target Languages

A GritQL snippet always attempts to match against a given _target language_.
If no target language is specified, JavaScript or one of its super languages is
assumed.

If you want to use a different target language, you must specify it explicitly.
For example, here is a CSS plugin to report any selector that sets a color
outside the allowed `.color-*` classes:

```grit
language css;

`$selector { $props }` where {
    $props <: contains `color: $color` as $rule,
    not $selector <: r"\.color-.*",
    register_diagnostic(
        span = $rule,
        message = "Don't set explicit colors. Use `.color-*` classes instead."
    )
}
```

We currently do not support other target languages than JavaScript and CSS.

## Plugin API

In addition to Grit's
[built-in functions](https://docs.grit.io/language/functions#built-in-functions),
Biome currently supports one extra function:

### `register_diagnostic()`

Registers a diagnostic to be reported whenever the pattern matches.

Supports three arguments:

- `span` (required): The syntax node to attach the diagnostic to. This is
  typically a variable that you matched within a code snippet.
- `message` (required): The message to show with the diagnostic.
- `severity`: The severity of the diagnostic. Allowed values are: `hint`,
  `information`, `warning`, and `error`. By default, `error` is used.
