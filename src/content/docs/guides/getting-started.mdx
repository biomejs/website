## Installation

The fastest way to download Biome is to use a package manager such as `npm`.
This requires Node.js v14.18 or newer.
The CLI is also available as a [standalone executable](/guides/manual-installation) if you want to use Biome without installing Node.js.

To install Biome, run the following commands in a directory containing a `package.json` file.

<PackageManagerCommand
  npm="install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome"
  pnpm="add --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome"
  yarn="add --dev --exact @biomejs/biome"
  bun="add --dev --exact @biomejs/biome"
  deno="add --dev npm:@biomejs/biome"
/>

:::note
We instruct the package manager to pin an exact version of Biome.
This ensures that everyone within a project has exactly the same version of Biome.
Even a patch release can result in slightly different behavior.
See the [versioning page](/internals/versioning/) for more information.

## Configuration

We recommend that you create a `biome.json` or a `biome.jsonc` configuration file for each project.
This eliminates the need to repeat the CLI options each time you run a command,
and ensures that Biome uses the same configuration in your editor.
Some options are also only available from a configuration file.
If you are happy with Biome's defaults, you don't need to create a configuration file.
To create the `biome.json` file, run the `init` command in the root folder of your project:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="init"/>

Pass the `--jsonc` option to emit a `biome.jsonc` file instead.

After running the `init` command, you'll have a new `biome.json` file in your directory:

<DefaultConfiguration/>

The `linter.enabled: true` enables the linter and `rules.recommended: true` enables the [recommended rules](/linter/rules/).
This corresponds to the default settings.

Formatting is enabled **by default**, but you can [disable](/reference/configuration/#formatterenabled) it by explicitly using `formatter.enabled: false`.

## Usage

The Biome CLI comes with many commands and options, so you can use only what you need.

You can format files and directories using the [`format`](/reference/cli#biome-format) command with the `--write` option:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="format --write <files>"/>

You can lint and apply [safe fixes](/linter#safe-fixes) to files and directories using the [`lint`](/reference/cli#biome-lint) command with the `--write` option:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="lint --write <files>"/>

You can run **both** of them by leveraging the [`check`](/reference/cli#biome-check) command:

<PackageManagerBiomeCommand command="check --write <files>"/>

The `check` command runs multiple tools at once.
It formats, lints, and organizes imports.

## Install an editor plugin

We recommend installing an editor plugin to get the most out of Biome.
Check out the [editor page](/guides/integrate-in-editor) to know which editors support Biome.

## CI Setup

If you're using Node.js, the recommended way to run Biome in CI is to use [your preferred package manager](/guides/getting-started#installation).
This ensures that your CI pipeline uses the same version of Biome as you do inside the editor or when running local CLI commands.
Alternatively, you can use a dedicated [CI Action](/recipes/continuous-integration).
