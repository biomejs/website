Biome can provide some tools that can help you to use it properly in big projects, such as monorepo or workspaces that contain multiple projects.


## Use multiple configuration files

When you use Biome's features - either with the CLI or LSP - the tool looks for the nearest configuration file using the current working directory.

If Biome doesn't find the configuration file there, it **starts walking upwards** the directories of the file system, until it finds one.

You can leverage this feature to apply different settings based on the project/folder.

Let's suppose we have a project that contains a backend app and new frontend app.


<FileTree>
  - app
    - backend
      - biome.json
      - package.json
    - frontend
      - biome.json
      - legacy-app
        - package.json
      - new-app
        - package.json
</FileTree>

This means that when you run a script from the file `app/backend/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`.

When you run a script from `app/frontend/legacy-app/package.json` or `app/frontend/new-app/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`.

## Share the configuration

It's possible to use the [`extends`](/guides/configure-biome/#share-a-configuration-file) configuration option to breakdown options across files.

Let's assume that we have these requirements:
- `legacy-app` have to format using spaces;
- `backend` and `new-app` have to format using tabs;
- all apps have to format using line width 120;
- `backend` app needs some extra linting;

We start by creating a new configuration file at `app/biome.json`, and put there the shared options:


```json title="app/biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "lineWidth": 120
  }
}
```

Now let's **move** `app/frontend/biome.json` to `app/frontend/legacy-app/`, because that's where we need to use a different formatting.


```json title="app/frontend/legacy-app/biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

Then, we tell Biome to inherit all the options from the main `app/biome.json` file, using the `extends` property:

```json title="app/frontend/legacy-app/biome.json" ins={2}
{
   "extends": ["../../biome.json"],
   "formatter": {
     "indentStyle": "space"
   }
}
```

Let's jump to `app/backend/biome.json`, where we need to enable the linting:


```json title="app/backend/biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["../biome.json"],
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Monorepo

Monorepos are particular repositories where multiple libraries are stored and maintained in one big repository. Each library represents a self-contained package, which can contain different configurations.

Since v2, Biome supports monorepos out of the box, and you'll need to set up the project in the following way.

<Steps>
1. Create a `biome.json` file at the root of the monorepo. We will use the recommended rules, and customise the formatter
    options.:

    ```json title="biome.json"
    {
        "linter": {
            "enabled": true,
            "rules": {
                "recommended": true
            }
        },
        "formatter": {
            "lineWidth": 120,
            "indentStyle": "space",
            "indentWidth": 6,
        }
    }
    ```
    This file is called **root configuration** and it sets the base options inside the project. However, nested
    configurations can decide to adhere to these options or not. Let's see how.

2. Create nested configuration files, one in each package, where is needed. These nested configuration files must have the
    field `"root"` set to `false`. Failing to do so will result into an error. Also, we want these packages the follow
    the formatting standards set up in the root configuration. In order to so, we will use a **new microsyntax**
    available in Biome v2, which is `"extends": "//"`. This syntax tells Biome to extends from the **root configuration**,
    regardless of where the nested configuration is.

    Let's create two configuration files,
    one inside `packages/logger` and one inside `packages/generate`. In the former we will disable `noConsole`, and in
    `packages/generate` we will disable the formatter because those are files that are code-generated:

    ```json title="packages/logger/biome.json"
    {
        "root": false,
        "extends": "//",
        "linter": {
            "rules": {
                "suspicious": {
                    "noConsole": "off"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ```json title="packages/generate/biome.json"
    {
        "root": false,
        "extends": "//",
        "formatter": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
    ```
    However, when you use the microsyntax `extends: "//"`, you can **omit**  `"root": false`, because it implies that this configuration isn't a
    a root configuration, and it wants extends from the root configuration:

    ```diff title="packages/generate/biome.json"
    {
    -   "root": false,
        "extends": "//",
        "formatter": {
        "enabled": false
    }
    ```
3. Now, let's suppose we have a new package in `packages/analytics`, maintained by another team that has different different coding standards.
    To change these options, you just need to omit `"extends": "//"` from the configuration file, and change the formatting options:
    ```json title="packages/analytics/biome.json"
    {
        "root": false,
        "formatter": {
            "lineWidth": 100,
        }
    }

    ```
4. Now that everything is set up, you have few options. You can run `biome` commands from the root of the project, or from the single packages.
    Biome will respect all settings!
</Steps>

### Limitations and constraints

To keep Biome as fast as possible, the nested configurations are discovered and loaded when at least one of these conditions is met:
- the VCS integration is enabled
- the CLI is run from the same folder where a root configuration file is present
- when running the command `biome search`, or the command `biome migrate`
- at least one project rule is enabled
- you open a project in the IDE (using our LSP integration)
