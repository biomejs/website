import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will help you to understand how to configure Biome.
It explains the structure of a Biome configuration file and how Biome resolves its configuration.
If you are already familiar with the configuration, you may want to take a look at the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/), which details all the options available.

Biome allows you to customize its behavior using CLI options or a configuration file named `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`.
We recommend that you create a configuration file for each project.
This ensures that each team member has the same configuration in the CLI and in any editor that allows Biome integration.
Many of the options available in a configuration file are also available in the CLI.

## Configuration file structure

A Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`. It is usually
placed in your project's root folder, next to your project's `package.json`.

Because Biome is a toolchain, its configuration is organized around the tools it
provides. At the moment, Biome provides three tools: the formatter, the linter
and the assist. All of these tools are enabled by default. You can disable one
or several of them using the `<tool>.enabled` field:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.0-beta/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "assist": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

Options that apply to more than one language are placed in the corresponding tool field.
Language-specific options of a tool are placed under a `<language>.<tool>` field.
This also allows overriding general options for a given language.
You can also enable or disable a tool based on the language.
In the following example, we configure the general options `formatter.indentStyle` and `formatter.lineWidth` for all the languages.
Also, we set the JavaScript-specific option `quoteStyle` in `javascript.formatter` and we override `formatter.lineWidth`.
We disabled the formatter for JSON files.

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space", // default is `tab`
    "lineWidth": 100 // default is `80`
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single", // default is `double`
      "lineWidth": 120 // override `formatter.lineWidth`
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "formatter": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Biome refers to all variants of the JavaScript language as `javascript`.
This includes TypeScript, JSX and TSX.

## Configuration file resolution

Biome uses auto discovery to find the nearest configuration file. It looks in
the working directory and its parent folders until it finds a `biome.json` or a
`biome.jsonc` file. If no configuration is found, Biome's default configuration
is used. If both `biome.json` and `biome.jsonc` are present in the same folder,
`biome.json` is used.

Here's an example:

<FileTree>
- app/
  - backend/
    - biome.json
    - package.json
  - frontend/
    - legacy/
      - package.json
    - new/
      - package.json
    - biome.json
</FileTree>


- Biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- Biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json`
will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;

:::caution
Biome doesn't yet support nested `biome.json` files, neither in CLI nor in LSP.

:::


## Specifying files to process

You can control the files/folders to process using different strategies, either CLI, configuration and VCS.

:::note
By default, Biome always ignores some files that are said to be **protected files**.
This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files.
At the moment, the following files are protected:

- `composer.lock`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
:::

### Include files via CLI

The first way to control which files and folders are processed by Biome is to
list them in the CLI. In the following command, we only format `file1.js` and
all the files in the `src` folder, because folders are recursively traversed.

```shell
biome format file1.js src/
```

:::caution
Glob patterns used on the command line are not interpreted by Biome.
They are expanded by your shell.
Some shells don't support the recursive glob `**`.
:::

### Control files via configuration

The Biome configuration file can be used to refine which files are processed.
You can explicitly list the files to be processed using
[the `files.includes` field](/reference/configuration). `files.includes` accepts
[glob patterns](/reference/configuration#glob-syntax-reference) such as
`src/**/*.js`. Negated patterns starting with `!` can be used to exclude files.

Paths and globs inside Biome's configuration file are resolved relative to the
folder the configuration file is in. An exception to this is when a
configuration file is [extended](#sharing-a-configuration-file) by another.

`files.includes` applies to all of Biome's tools, meaning the files specified
here are processed by the linter, the formatter and the assist, unless specified
otherwise. For the individual tools, you can further refine the matching files
using `<tool>.includes`.


#### Include files via configuration

Let's take the following configuration, where we want to include only JavaScript files (`.js`) that are inside
the `src/` folder, the `test/` folder, and ignore files that have `.min.js` in their name:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js", "test/**/*.js", "!**/*.min.js"]
  },
  "linter": {
    "includes": ["!test/**"]
  }
}
```

And run the following command:

```shell
biome format test/
```

The command will format the files that end with the `.js` extension and don't
end with the `.min.js` extension from the `test/` folder.

The files in `src/` are not formatted because the folder is not listed in the
CLI.

If we run the following command, no files are linted because files inside the
`test/` folder are explicitly ignored for the linter.

```shell
biome lint test/
```

:::caution
The global `files.includes` has slightly different semantics than the more
specific `<tool>.includes` fields. Any file or folder that doesn't match
`files.includes` is excluded from use by any of Biome's tools. This means that
any tool-specific `includes` field can never match a file that doesn't also
match `files.includes`.
:::

#### Exclude files via configuration

If you want to exclude files and folders from being processed by Biome, you can use the `files.includes` configuration
and use the negated patterns, using the leading `!`.

Before listing the negated globs, **they must be preceded by the `**` pattern**.

In the following example, we tell Biome to include files, excluded the `dist` directory, and all files that have `.generated.js` in their name

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": [
      "**",
      "!**/dist/**",
      "!**/*.generated.js"
    ]
  }
}
```


### Control files via VCS

You can [ignore files ignored by your VCS](/guides/integrate-in-vcs#use-the-ignore-file).


## Well-known files

Here are some well-known files that we specifically treat based on their file names, rather than their extensions.
Currently, the well-known files are JSON-like files only, but we may broaden the list to include other types when we support new parsers.

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with both the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`.

- `.all-contributorsrc`
- `.arcconfig`
- `.auto-changelog`
- `.bowerrc`
- `.c8rc`
- `.htmlhintrc`
- `.imgbotconfig`
- `.jslintrc`
- `.nycrc`
- `.tern-config`
- `.tern-project`
- `.vuerc`
- `.watchmanconfig`
- `mcmod.info`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` set to `true` but `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`. This is because the tools consuming these files can only strip comments.

- `.ember-cli`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.jscsrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `tslint.json`
- `turbo.json`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because the tools consuming these files are designed to accommodate such settings.

- `.babelrc`
- `.babelrc.json`
- `.devcontainer.json`
- `.hintrc`
- `.hintrc.json`
- `.swcrc`
- `api-documenter.json`
- `api-extractor.json`
- `babel.config.json`
- `deno.json`
- `devcontainer.json`
- `dprint.json`
- `jsconfig.json`
- `jsr.json`
- `language-configuration.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `typedoc.json`
- `typescript.json`


## Sharing a configuration file

The `extends` field allows you to split your configuration across multiple
files. This way, you can share common settings across different projects or
folders.

Here's an example of how you might set up your configuration to extend a
`common.json` configuration file:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["./common.json"]
}
```

The entries defined in `extends` are resolved from the path where the
`biome.json` file is defined. They are processed in the order they are listed,
with settings in later files overriding earlier ones.

Files that you `extend` from cannot `extend` other files in turn.

Note that paths in a configuration file are always resolved from the folder in
which the `biome.json`/`biome.jsonc` file resides. When using the `extends`
field, this means that paths in a shared configuration are interpreted from the
location of the configuration that is extending it, and not from the folder
of the file being extended.

For example, let's assume a project that contains two directories `backend/` and
`frontend/`, each having their own `biome.json` that both extend a `common.json`
configuration in the root folder:

<FileTree>
- backend/
  - src/
    - ...
  - test/
    - ...
  - biome.json
- frontend/
  - src/
    - ...
  - test/
    - ...
  - biome.json
- common.json
</FileTree>

```json title="common.json"
{
  "files": {
    "includes": ["src/**/*.js", "test/**/*.js"],
  },
  "linter": {
    "includes": ["!test/**"]
  }
}
```

```json title="frontend/biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["../common.json"]
}
```

* When running Biome from the `frontend/` folder, it will be configured to
  format and lint all JavaScript files in the `frontend/src/` and
  `frontend/test/` folders, and only format the files in the `frontend/src/`
  folder. This works because the paths specified in `common.json` are
  interpreted from the `frontend/` folder, because that's where the `biome.json`
  file resides.
* Assuming `backend/biome.json` looks the same as `frontend/biome.json`, it will
  have the same behaviour, except the paths will be interpreted from the
  `backend/` folder.

### Exporting a Biome configuration from an NPM package

Biome is able to resolve configuration files from the `node_modules/` folder.
So you can export your configuration file from a package, and import it in
multiple projects.

In order to do so, the first thing to do is to set up your "shared" Biome
configuration in a certain way. Let's suppose that you want to share a
configuration from a package called `@org/shared-configs`, using the specifier
`@org/shared-configs/biome`. You have to create an `exports` entry in the
`package.json` of this package:

```json title="package.json" ins={5,3}
{
  "name": "@org/shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.json"
  }
}
```

Make sure that `@org/shared-configs` is correctly installed in your project, and
update the `biome.json` file to look like the following snippet:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["@org/shared-configs/biome"]
}
```

Biome will attempt to resolve your library `@org/shared-configs/` from your
working directory. The working directory is:

- when using the CLI, the folder where you execute your scripts from.
  Usually it matches the location of your `package.json` file;
- when using the LSP, the root folder of your project.

:::caution
Paths starting with a dot `.` or ending with `.json` or `.jsonc` are always
treated as relative paths, so they won't be resolved from `node_modules/`.
