import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will help you to understand how to configure Biome.
It explains the structure of a Biome configuration file and how Biome resolves its configuration.
If you are already familiar with the configuration, you may want to take a look at the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/), which details all the options available.

Biome allows you to customize its behavior using CLI options or a configuration file named `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`.
We recommend that you create a configuration file for each project.
This ensures that each team member has the same configuration in the CLI and in any editor that allows Biome integration.
Many of the options available in a configuration file are also available in the CLI.

## Configuration file structure

A Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`.
It is usually placed in your project's root directory, next to your project's `package.json`.

Because Biome is a toolchain, its configuration is organized around the tools it provides.
At the moment, Biome provides three tools: the formatter, the linter and the assist.
All of these tools are enabled by default.
You can disable one or several of them using the `<tool>.enabled` field:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.0-beta/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "assist": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

Options that apply to more than one language are placed in the corresponding tool field.
Language-specific options of a tool are placed under a `<language>.<tool>` field.
This also allows overriding general options for a given language.
You can also enable or disable a tool based on the language.
In the following example, we configure the general options `formatter.indentStyle` and `formatter.lineWidth` for all the languages.
Also, we set the JavaScript-specific option `quoteStyle` in `javascript.formatter` and we override `formatter.lineWidth`.
We disabled the formatter for JSON files.

```json5 title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space", // default is `tab`
    "lineWidth": 100 // default is `80`
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single", // default is `double`
      "lineWidth": 120 // override `formatter.lineWidth`
    }
  },
  "json": {
    "formatter": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Biome refers as `javascript` all variants of the JavaScript language.
This includes TypeScript, JSX and TSX.

## Configuration file resolution

Biome uses auto discovery to find the nearest configuration file.
It looks in the working directory and in the parent directories until it finds a `biome.json` or a `biome.jsonc` file.
If no configuration is found, then it applies Biome's defaults.
If both `biome.json` and `biome.jsonc` are present in the same folder, the priority will be given to `biome.json`.

Here's an example:

<FileTree>
- app
  - backend
    - biome.json
    - package.json
  - frontend
    - biome.json
    - legacy
      - package.json
    - new
      - package.json
</FileTree>


- Biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- Biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json`
will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;

:::caution
Biome doesn't support nested `biome.json` files, neither in CLI nor in LSP. [Follow and help the support in the related issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2228)
:::

:::note
Biome commands support using the `--config-path` option and the `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
This allows you to specify a custom configuration file or a directory where Biome can look for a `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc` file.
When you use `--config-path` or `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH`, the standard configuration file resolution process is **disabled**.

If `--config-path` or `BIOME_CONFIG_PATH` points directly to a file, you can use names other than `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`.
Biome will read a `.json` file using a standard JSON parser.
For files with other extensions, Biome will treat them as `.jsonc` files, using a more flexible JSON parser that allows comments and trailing commas.

## Share a configuration file

The `extends` field allows you to split your configuration across multiple files.
This way, you can share common settings across different projects or folders.

Here's an example of how you might set up your configuration to extend a `common.json` configuration file:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["./common.json"]
}
```

The entries defined in `extends` are resolved from the path where the `biome.json` file is defined.
They are processed in the order they are listed, with settings in later files overriding earlier ones.

Biome is able to resolve configuration files from the `node_modules/` directory.
So you can export your configuration file from a package, and import it in multiple projects.

In order to do so, the first thing to do is to set up your "shared" Biome configuration in a certain way.
Let's suppose that you want to share a configuration from a package called `@org/shared-configs`, using the specifier `@org/shared-configs/biome`.
You have to create an `exports` entry in the `package.json` of this package:

```json title="package.json" ins={5,3}
{
  "name": "@org/shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.json"
  }
}
```

Make sure that `@org/shared-configs` is correctly installed in your project, and update the `biome.json` file to look like the following snippet:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["@org/shared-configs/biome"]
}
```

Biome will attempt to **resolve** your library `@org/shared-configs/` from your working directory.
The working directory is:

- when using the CLI, the directory where you execute your scripts from.
  Usually it matches the location of your `package.json` file;
- when using the LSP, the root directory of your project.

:::caution
To avoid a breaking change with how the existing resolution works, paths starting with a dot `.` or ending with `.json` or `.jsonc` **won't** be resolved from `node_modules/`.
:::

For more information about the resolution algorithm, refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).


## Ignore files

The first way to control which files and directories are processed by Biome is to list them in the CLI.
In the following command, we format only `file1.js` and all the files in the `src` directory.
The directories are recursively traversed.

```shell
biome format file1.js src/
```

:::caution
Glob patterns used on the command line are not interpreted by Biome.
They are expanded by your shell.
Some shells don't support the recursive glob `**`.
:::

The Biome configuration file can be used to refine which files are processed.
You can explicitly list the files to be processed using `include` and the files not to be processed using `ignore`.
`include` and `ignore` accepts globs patterns such as `src/**/*.js`.
See the [related section](#glob-syntax-explained) for which glob syntaxes are supported.
`include` is always applied first before applying `ignore`.
This allows you to include some files and to ignore some of the file you included.

:::note
`include` and `ignore` have a slightly different semantics.
`include` doesn't prevent Biome of traversing a folder.
This means that if you want to prevent Biome from traversing a folder, you have to add the folder to `ignore`.
:::

Biome provides global `files.include` and `files.ignore` fields that apply to all tools.
You can also include and ignore files at tool level using `<tool>.include` and `<tool>.ignore`.
Note that they don't override the global `files.include` and `files.ignore`.
`files.include` and `files.ignore` are applied first before a tool's `include` and `ignore`.

Let's take the following configuration:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "include": ["src/**/*.js", "test/**/*.js"],
    "ignore": ["**/*.min.js"],
  },
  "linter": {
    "ignore": ["test"]
  }
}
```

And run the following command:

```shell
biome format test/
```

The command will format the files that end with the `.js` extension and doesn't end with the `.min.js` extension from the `test` directory.
The files in `src` are not formatted because the directory is not listed in the CLI.

If we run the following command, no files are linted because the `test` directory is explicitly ignored for the linter.

```shell
biome lint test/
```

Biome resolves the globs relatively from the working directory.
The working directory is the directory where you usually run a CLI command.
This means that you have to place **particular attention** when the configuration file is placed in
a different directory from where you execute your command.
In the case of an editor (LSP) the working directory is the root directory of your project.

Let's take a project that contains two directories `backend/` and `frontend/`, and the Biome configuration file that we introduced earlier.
Inside the `frontend/` directory, a `package.json` specifies a `format` script that runs the Biome formatter.

<FileTree>
- backend
  - ...
- biome.json
- frontend
  - package.json
  - src
    - ...
  - test
    - ...
</FileTree>

```json title="frontend/package.json"
{
  "name": "frontend-project",
  "scripts": {
    "format": "biome format --write ./"
  }
}
```

When you run the script `format` from `frontend/package.json`,
the working directory resolved by that script will be `frontend/`.
The globs `src/**/*.js` and `test/**/*.js` will have as "base" directory `frontend/`.
Thus, only the files from `frontend/src/` and `frontend/test/` will be formatted.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "include": ["src/**/*.js", "src/**/*.ts"],
    "ignore": ["test"]
  },
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

:::caution
`ignore` and `include` inside `overrides` have a **different** semantics:
- for `ignore`: if a file matches the globs, **_don't_ apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;
- for `include`: if a file matches the globs, **apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;
:::

:::note
By default, Biome always ignores some files that are said to be **protected files**.
This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files.
At the moment, the following files are protected:

- `composer.lock`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
:::

:::note
You can also [ignore files ignored by your VCS](/guides/integrate-in-vcs#use-the-ignore-file).

## Well-known files

Here are some well-known files that we specifically treat based on their file names, rather than their extensions.
Currently, the well-known files are JSON-like files only, but we may broaden the list to include other types when we support new parsers.

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with both the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`.

- `.all-contributorsrc`
- `.arcconfig`
- `.auto-changelog`
- `.bowerrc`
- `.c8rc`
- `.htmlhintrc`
- `.imgbotconfig`
- `.jslintrc`
- `.nycrc`
- `.tern-config`
- `.tern-project`
- `.vuerc`
- `.watchmanconfig`
- `mcmod.info`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` set to `true` but `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`. This is because the tools consuming these files can only strip comments.

- `.ember-cli`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.jscsrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `tslint.json`
- `turbo.json`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because the tools consuming these files are designed to accommodate such settings.

- `.babelrc`
- `.babelrc.json`
- `.devcontainer.json`
- `.hintrc`
- `.hintrc.json`
- `.swcrc`
- `api-documenter.json`
- `api-extractor.json`
- `babel.config.json`
- `deno.json`
- `devcontainer.json`
- `dprint.json`
- `jsconfig.json`
- `jsr.json`
- `language-configuration.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `typedoc.json`
- `typescript.json`


## Glob syntax explained

A glob pattern specifies a set of filenames.
Biome supports the following globs:

- `*` matches zero or more characters. It cannot match the path separator `/`.
- `**` recursively matches directories and files.
  This sequence **must** form a single path component,
  so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result in an error.
  A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also invalid.
- `[...]` matches any character inside the brackets.
  Ranges of characters can also be specified, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g.
  `[0-9]` specifies any character between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `[!...]` is the negation of `[...]`, i.e. it matches any characters **not** in the brackets.

Some examples:

- `dist/**` matches the dist directory and all files in this directory.
- `**/test/**` matches all files under any directory named `test`, regardless of where they are. E.g. `dist/test`, `src/test`.
- `**/*.js` matches all files ending with the extension `.js` in all directories.

Biome uses a glob library that treats all globs as having a `**/` prefix.
This means that `src/**/*.js` and `**/src/**/*.js` are treated as identical.
They match both `src/file.js` and `test/src/file.js`.

:::caution
These patterns can be used in a Biome configuration file.
Glob patterns used on the command line are not interpreted by Biome.
They are expanded by your shell.
Some shells don't support the recursive glob `**`
