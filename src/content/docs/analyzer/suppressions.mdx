description: How to use suppressions.

The Biome analyzer is the foundation of the [linter](/linter) and [assist](/assist); in fact, both tools share a lot of similarities.

Among them, they share the same suppression engine, which means that you can suppress a lint rule the same way you would suppress an assist action.

With suppression, it's possible to turn off a lint rule (or action) for a specific line of code, a range, or the entire file.

Suppression is achievable with **suppression comments**.

## Suppression syntax

Suppression comments have the following format:

```js
// biome-ignore lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore assist: <explanation>
// biome-ignore syntax: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: <explanation>
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger(foo): <explanation>
// biome-ignore-all lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore-start lint: <explanation>
// biome-ignore-end lint: <explanation>
```

Let's break it down:

- `biome-ignore`, `biome-ignore-all`, `biome-ignore-start` and `biome-ignore-end` are the start of a suppression comment.
- After the space follows the **category** of the suppression comment. It can be `lint`, `assist`, or `syntax`.
- The category is followed by an optional group, or group and name, separated by slashes. For example, `/suspicious` or `/suspicious/noDebugger`. The more you specify, the more specific (i.e. targeted) your suppression is.
- Some rules even allow you to specify values during suppression. These can be specified between parentheses, for example: `(foo)`. Refer to the rule documentation to see whether a rule supports suppression with values.
- `<explanation>` explanation why the rule is disabled.

If you're unsure of the exact category of a rule/action, you can refer to their documentation page and use their *diagnostic category*.

:::note
From here onwards, JavaScript is used to explain suppression comments, and the `lint` category is used.

### Inline suppressions

They disable a lint rule for the **next line** of code.

In the following example, the suppression comment `biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` will disable the `debugger;` statement at line 2, but the `debugger` at line 3 will still raise a diagnostic:

```js title="file.js" ins={1}
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger;
debugger;
```

### Top-level suppressions

They disable a lint rule for an entire file. They must be placed **at the top of the file**, and they must start with `biome-ignore-all`.

These suppression comments are very useful when you want to suppression some lint rule *for a particular file*, and you don't want to rely on a single configuration override to achieve that.

In the following example, the suppression comment `biome-ignore-all lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` will disable the lint rule for all lines in `generated.js`:

```js title="generated.js" ins={1}
// biome-ignore-all lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason

debugger
debugger

```

When a top-level suppression comment isn't at the top of the file, it is considered *unused* and Biome will emit a diagnostic with category `suppression/unused`.

### Range suppressions

They disable a lint rule from a particular _range_ in the file, starting from the line with the start comment, until the line with the end comment.

To mark the beginning of a range suppression, the suppression comment must start with `// biome-ignore-start`. To mark the end of it, the suppression comment must start with `// biome-ignore-end`.

The following example will disable the rule `lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals` for line 2 and 3, but line 5 will raise a diagnostic:

```js name="file.js" ins={1} ins={4}
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
a == b;
c == d;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
f == g;
```

:::note
Range suppressions must have a matching `biome-ignore-end` suppression.
:::

Range suppressions can also overlap.  Consider the following example:

```js name="file.js"
debugger;
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger
// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
a == b;
c == d;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason
debugger
f == g;
// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
```

In the above code:

- The `debugger` statement at line 1 will raise a diagnostic because there's no suppression comment that disables it.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` at line 2 starts disabling `noDebugger` from line 3 onwards.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-start lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason` at line 4 starts disabling `noDoubleEquals` from line 5 onwards.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals: reason` at line 7 terminates the suppression of `noDoubleEquals` that was started by the suppression comment at line 4.
- The `debugger` statement at line 8 **doesn't** raise diagnostics due to the suppression comment at line 2.
- The `f == g` statement raises a diagnostic because the rule `noDoubleEquals` isn't suppressed anymore.
- The comment `// biome-ignore-end lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason` at line 7 terminates the suppression of `noDebugger` that was started by the suppression comment at line 2.
