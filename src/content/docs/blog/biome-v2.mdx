We are happy to announce that Biome v2 is officially out! 🍾 Biome v2 is the _first_ JavaScript and TypeScript linter that provides
**type-aware linting rules that doesn't rely on the TypeScript compiler**! This means that you can lint your project
without necessarily installing the `typescript` package.

With this release, the [Core Contributors of the project](/internals/credits#core-contributors) want to show
to the whole community and web ecosystem that Biome is here to stay and deserves to earn its place as the next-generation toolchain for the web.
No other tools have achieved this great milestone in such a short amount of time ([two years](/blog/announcing-biome)) and resources. This has been possible
thanks to the companies and people who believed in the project, with a special shoutout to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for sponsoring the type inference work.

Preliminary testing shows that our [`noFloatingPromises` rule](/linter/rules/no-floating-promises/), which is based on our new type inference work, can detect floating promises in about 60% of the cases that would be detected by using `typescript-eslint`, at a fraction of the performance impact. And needless to say, we have plenty of ideas on how to improve this metric even further.

Keep in mind that your mileage may vary, as these early numbers are based on a limited set of use cases. Nevertheless, we look forward to people trying it out and reporting their experiences so that we can quickly reach a level of confidence that would be sufficient for most projects.

## Installation and migration

Install or update the `@biomejs/biome` package. If you upgrade the package, run the `migrate` command.

```shell
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
npx @biomejs/biome migrate --write
```

The `migrate` command will take care of all the breaking changes of the configuration, so you don't have to. However, there are
some other changes that we couldn't automate. We created a [migration guide](/guides/upgrade-to-biome-v2) that explains them,
together with manual migration paths, if applicable. Please get accustomed to the changes, as some of them fundamentally
change some of the core functionalities of Biome (for the better!).

## Relevant features

Biome is packed with new features, some big and some small. We will focus on the ones that we believe are worth
mentioning. For a complete list of the new features, refer to the [web version of the changelog](/internals/changelog).

### Multi-file analysis and type inference

These two features are closely related. You can't create a type inference engine without the ability to query types imported from
other modules.

Before version 2.0, Biome lint rules could only operate on one file at a time. This brought us far, but many of the more interesting rules require information from other files too.

To accomplish this, we have added a _file scanner_ to Biome that scans all the files in your project and indexes them, similar to what an LSP service might do in your IDE.

A file scanner comes with its baggage: slowness. We acknowledge that many users chose Biome for its speed. During the beta period, users raised some concerns about how this could affect their workflow.

As for this release, the file scanner has the following characteristics:
- It's **completely opt-in**; which means migrating from v1 to v2 won't significantly affect the performance of formatting and linting your projects.
- If the VCS integration is enabled, the scanner is used to discover nested `.gitignore` files.
- A **full scan** (which scans all your project files **and** `node_modules`) is performed *only* when [project rules](/linter/domains#project) are enabled.
- Users can control the scanned files using `files.includes`, with the exception of `node_modules`.
- Lint rules that need to collect types or query the module graph **will never be recommended** outside the [`project` domain](/linter/domains/#project). We put speed and performance first, and users have control over the rules.

Finally, we designed the multi-file analysis with monorepos in mind. Although full monorepo support did not make it in time for the 2.0 release, we expect to deliver more on this front soon.

### Plugins

Biome 2.0 comes with our first iteration of [Linter Plugins](/linter/plugins).

These plugins are still limited in scope: They only allow you to match code snippets and report diagnostics on them.

Here is an example of a plugin that reports on all usages of `Object.assign()`:

```grit
`$fn($args)` where {
    $fn <: `Object.assign`,
    register_diagnostic(
        span = $fn,
        message = "Prefer object spread instead of `Object.assign()`"
    )
}
```

It's a first step, but we have plenty of ideas for making them more powerful, and we're eager to hear from our users about what they would like to see prioritised.


### Import Organizer Revamp

In Biome 1.x, our Import Organizer had several limitations:

* Groups of imports separated by a blank line were considered separate _chunks_, meaning they were sorted independently. This meant the following **didn't work** as expected:

  ```js title="example.js"
  import { lib2 } from "library2";

  import { util } from "./utils.js";
  import { lib1 } from "library1";
  ```

  It would correctly sort `"library1"` to be placed above `"./utils.js"`, but it wouldn't be able to
  carry it over the blank line to the top. This is what we got:

  ```js title="organizer_v1.js"
  import { lib2 } from "library2";

  import { lib1 } from "library1";
  import { util } from "./utils.js";
  ```

  But instead, what we really wanted was this:

  ```js title="organizer_v2.js"
  import { lib1 } from "library1";
  import { lib2 } from "library2";

  import { util } from "./utils.js";
  ```

* Imports from the same module were not merged. Consider the following example:

  ```js title="example.js"
  import { util1 } from "./utils.js";
  import { util2 } from "./utils.js";
  ```

  What we wanted was this:

  ```js title="organizer_v2.js"
  import { util1, util2 } from "./utils.js";
  ```

* No custom ordering could be configured. Perhaps you didn't really like the default approach of ordering by "distance" from the source that you're importing from. Perhaps you wanted to organise the imports like this:

  ```js title="organizer_v2.js"
  import { open } from "node:fs";

  import { internalLib1 } from "@company/library1";
  import { internalLib2 } from "@company/library2";

  import { lib1 } from "library1";
  ```

In Biome 2.0, all these limitations are lifted. In fact, if you look at the examples above, all snippets labeled `organizer_v2.js` can be produced just like that by our new import organizer.

Other improvements include support for organizing `export` statements, support for "detached" comments to explicitly separate import chunks if necessary, and import attribute sorting.

You can find more in the [documentation of the action](/assist/actions/organize-imports).


### Assists

The Import Organizer has always been a bit of a special case in Biome. It was neither part of the linter, nor of the formatter. This was because we didn't want it to show diagnostics like the linter does, and its organizing features exceeded what we expect from the formatter.

In Biome 2.0, we have generalised such use cases in the form of Biome Assist. Assist provides **actions**, which are similar to the _fixes_ in lint rules, but without the diagnostics.

The Import Organizer has become an assist, but we've started using this approach for new assists too: [`useSortedKeys`](https://next.biomejs.dev/assist/actions/use-sorted-keys/) can sort keys in object literals, while [`useSortedAttributes`](https://next.biomejs.dev/assist/actions/use-sorted-attributes/) can sort attributes in JSX.

For more information about assists, see: https://next.biomejs.dev/assist/

### Improved suppressions

In addition to the `// biome-ignore` comments we already supported, we now support `// biome-ignore-all` for suppressing a lint rule or the formatter in an entire file.

We also added support for suppression ranges using `// biome-ignore-start` and `// biome-ignore-end`. Note that `// biome-ignore-end` is optional in case you want to let a range run until the end of the file.

For more information about suppressions, see: https://next.biomejs.dev/linter/#suppress-lint-rules

### HTML formatter

After several months of hard work, we are pleased to announce that the HTML formatter is now ready for users to try out and report bugs! This is a huge step towards Biome fully supporting HTML-ish templating languages used in frameworks such as Vue and Svelte.

TFor now, he HTML formatter only touches actual `.html` files, so it doesn't format HTML in `.vue` or `.svelte` files yet. It also won't format embedded languages like JavaScript or CSS yet. HTML's options like `attributePosition`, `bracketSameLine`, and `whitespaceSensitivity` have been implemented.

The HTML formatter is still in the experimental stage, so it will remain **disabled by default for the full 2.0 release**. At the time of writing, Biome can parse most of the Prettier's HTML test suite, and format 46/124 of them correctly. Despite not matching Prettier yet, we're pretty confident that it _should_ output adequately formatted documents without destroying anything. If you find a case where it doesn't, [please let us know](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues)!

You can enable the HTML formatter by adding the following to your config file:

```json
{
  "html": {
    "formatter": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```
