As of today, we're happy to announce that [Depot](https://depot.dev) has become **Biome's exclusive platinum sponsor**!

## Biome by the numbers

Biome is a **big Rust project**, that keeps growing over time. As of 17 November (time of writing of the blog post), the project has the following stats:
- A total of 90 internal crates (AKA `biome_*` crates) that are compiled and shipped in production.
- <LocaleNumber number={651971} approximation={true} /> lines of code between production code and test code.
- <LocaleNumber number={3217} approximation={true} /> Rust files, between production code and test code.

Since Rust is a compiled language, with complex syntax, the resources required for compilation, testing, etc. are bound to increase over time. Before Depot came to the rescue, Biome used to use GitHub Action runners. Here's a few numbers:

- Linting for pull requests took around ~15 minutes.
- Tests for pull requests took around ~20 minutes.
- Benchmarks for pull requests took around ~30 minutes. Benchmarks take longer because the code is compiled in production mode, and we make sure to stress test
  our infrastructure by feeding the benchmarks very complex inputs.
- A release might have required up to ~45 minutes.
- At some point, Biome on Windows couldn't compile due to the memory required, which exceeded the memory available in the GitHub Actions runners.

## Enter Depot

I discovered Depot by chance on social media. Someone thanked them for sponsoring their Rust project, so I reached out to see if they'd be willing to sponsor Biome. [Jacob Gillespie](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie), CTO and Co-Founder at Depot, was incredibly responsive and eager to support us.

Depot started sponsoring Biome's GitHub infrastructure months ago as a gold sponsor. With their faster [GitHub Actions runners](https://depot.dev/docs/github-actions/overview), our workflows saw dramatic improvements:

  | Workflow   | Before (GitHub runners) | After (Depot) |
  |------------|-------------------------|---------------|
  | Linting    | ~15 minutes             | ~2 minutes    |
  | Tests      | ~20 minutes             | ~4 minutes    |
  | Benchmarks | ~30 minutes             | ~15 minutes   |
  | Releases   | ~45 minutes             | ~25 minutes   |

## Depot's impact on the ecosystem

These aren't just numbers. Having a faster CI has had a significant **positive impact** to maintainers, contributors and end-users.

### Maintainers

We've seen positive outcomes throughout the entire project management process. We're able to get faster feedback from our CI jobs, release more frequently and with more confidence, and we can fix CI issues faster. As you know, CI is a [YOLO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yolo) practice!

### Contributors

Contributors can see the effect of their PRs way faster than before, and they can fix possible bugs promptly. This means that by the time a maintainer comes and reviews the PR, it might be approved already because the CI is green! One reason why we're able to ship so many fixes in every patch release.

### End-users

End-users - you, the developers - can enjoy that fix you needed sooner than before!

## Depot's endorsement

As Vercel did before, Depot believes that [Biome's inference engine](/blog/vercel-partners-biome-type-inference/) can and will improve the developer experience even further.

Depot believes in Biome's mission, a unified toolchain where users can think less about their tools and dependencies, and more about building their own software using modern practices.

**Thank you, Depot!**

## I like where this is going, how can I help?

I want to remind you that Biome is a project led by volunteers who like programming, open-source, and embrace the Biome philosophy, so any help is welcome 😁

#### Translations

If you are familiar with Biome and would like to contribute to its outreach, you can assist us by translating the website into your native language. In this [dashboard](https://biomejs.dev/i18n-dashboard/), you can check the supported languages and if they are up to date.

#### Chat with us

Join our [Discord server](https://biomejs.dev/chat), and engage with the community. Chatting with the community and being part of the community is a form of contribution.

#### Code contributions

If you like the technical aspects of the project, and you want to make your way into the Rust language, or you wish to practice your knowledge around parsers, compilers, analysers, etc., Biome is the project that does for you!

There are numerous aspects to explore; I assure you that you won't get bored. Here is a small list of the things you can start with:
- Create new lint rules! We have so many rules that we haven't implemented yet (ESLint, ESLint plugins, Next.js, Solid, etc.). We have a very [extensive technical guide](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/crates/biome_analyze/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [Help](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/crates/biome_parser/CONTRIBUTING.md) [building](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/tree/main/crates/biome_yaml_parser) [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/tree/main/crates/biome_html_parser) [parsers](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/tree/main/crates/biome_markdown_parser)!
  One interesting fact about Biome parsers is that they are recoverable parsers [error resilient](/internals/architecture/#parser-and-cst) which emit a [CST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree) instead of a classic AST.
- Implement new capabilities in our [LSP (Language Server Protocol)](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/tree/main/crates/biome_lsp), or add new features in one of our editor extensions: [VS Code](https://github.com/biomejs/biome-vscode), [Zed](https://github.com/biomejs/biome-zed) and [JetBrains IntelliJ](https://github.com/biomejs/biome-intellij).

#### Financial help

If you believe in the future of the project, you can also help with a financial contribution, via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/biome) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/biomejs).

Additionally, the project provides an [enterprise support program](/enterprise) that allows companies to employ one of the core contributors to work on a specific aspect of the Biome toolchain.
